 Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to take a look at the difference between having and where. Now in the last lesson, we looked at GroupBuy and OrderBuy. The most obvious thing to do would be to come right here and say where, and we're going to say this column, which is actually named this, we'll say where the average age, let's say is greater than 40, which would only be the males. So let's go ahead and run this. And as you can see, we're not getting any output. Let's bring this up and take a look at the error. It says invalid use of the GroupBuy function. What's actually happening is something to do with this GroupBuy gender right here. When we're selecting gender and then we're performing an aggregate function, this occurs only after the GroupBuy actually groups those rows together. So when we're trying to filter based off of this column right here of average age, it really hasn't been created yet because this GroupBuy hasn't happened. That's where the having clause comes into play. So let's go ahead and what we're going to do is we're going to get rid of this. We're going to come right down here and instead of where we're going to say having. Now, having was specifically created for this exact example. It comes right after GroupBuy and after GroupBuy, we can filter based off of these aggregate functions. So now if we run this, we're going to get an output that only has where the average age is greater than 40. Now let's take a look at just one more example and I'm going to show you how you can use both and one query. So instead of demographics, let's look at the salary table and let's run it. Now in this salary table, we have this occupation and remember we have this office manager that happens twice and this is going to be our main example. So we're going to say occupation and then we'll say the average salary. Now we'll need to come down here and we'll say GroupBuy. Now we're going to say occupation. So this should look pretty similar because right here we have our office manager and one of the office managers made 50, one of the office managers made 60 so the average is 55,000. Now I can use the where by saying where. Now I'll say occupation like and let's see people who are managers. So I'll say percent manager percent and close that quote. So they're like a manager and then I want to see where a manager makes more than let's say 75,000. So I won't actually say where I'm going to say having an average salary and then you add a space there. Having an average salary greater than let's say 75,000. And let's run this. So now I filtered at the row level right here in the where clause but then down here I filtered at the aggregate function level. This having is only going to work for aggregated functions after the GroupBuy actually runs. So that is the difference between the having clause and the where clause. The where clause you're most likely going to use a lot more. But if you do want to filter on this aggregated function columns, you have to use the having clause. I hope that that was really helpful. And in the next lesson, we're looking at our very last lesson in our beginner series. We're going to look at limit and alias ID.
