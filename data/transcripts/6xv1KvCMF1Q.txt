 What's going on everybody welcome back to another video today we are starting our Tableau tutorial series. Now this series is for absolute beginners so if you have never used Tableau before you were in the perfect place I'm gonna take you all the way from the very beginning of installing it and just understanding what Tableau is and how you can use it all the way to creating dashboards and sharing it. Now personally I hate those videos that are like three hours long and they just expect you to go through it I'd like to break my videos up in the chunks so if you have ever done my sequel tutorials you'll know that I like to break things up so it gives you time to try them out and do them yourself and then you can move on to the next video so I'm going to be breaking this up into five separate videos but in this video I'm going to show you how to install Tableau for free. I'm going to show you these are interface we're going to download a data set that you can find on Kaggle and then we will build our first visualization together with that being said let's jump over my screen and we'll get started. Alright so the very first thing that we need to do is you need to actually download Tableau so we're not going to be using Tableau we're going to be using a free version called Tableau Public it has a lot of the same features except of course it's not every single feature that regular Tableau has but it is absolutely perfect for learning it and for using it and you can even build you know dashboards and share those for your portfolio. I'm going to put this link in the description so you can just go and click on that and all you have to do is input your email right here and click download the app and then it should start to download and then you can save that and then you're going to open this up. Now I'm going to open it up I don't know what it's going to do I already have it downloaded but it should open up and look hopefully like what you're seeing on my screen in just a second let's see what it does. I hope you can see this but it says Tableau Public it says I already have it set up but you're going to click install and go through all that all that setup stuff so I'm going to exit out of here but I'm going to go over here and type in Tableau Public it's 2021.3 that's the current version that they have out if you're doing this in the future they may have you know different versions so you should be able to pull this up right here now I'm going to go and get our data set that we're going to be using and I'm going to show you how to get that as well and then we will actually jump into Tableau and start using it. So let's go over here I'm going to get a data set from Kaggle I wanted something pretty generic to show you in future videos I'm going to show you some special or not special but just different visualizations that you might use and we'll get different data sets for those because of course not one data set covers all these other types of visualizations so we're starting up pretty simple right here we're going to be getting one called video game sales and we can take a really quick look at it here are some of the fields that you're going to be having like rank name platform the year genre and then some sales data and this is what it actually looks like it's called VG sales so video game sales into the CSV and you know here are the fields and we have our data and all we are going to do is we're going to download that and I will save it now when you download it it's going to be saved into a zip file so we need to go to our downloads let's refresh this here's our archive we need to go in here you can just copy it and paste it right back into here and just so you know that is a CSV so be aware of that so what we want to do is we want to come in here now since it is a CSV this is not we're not going to use Microsoft Excel we're going to be using the text file so we'll come in here we'll take VG sales now one thing I want to do before I do that is I'm going to rename mine VG sales I just go one I've already prepared for this and so I already have that in there but I so I want to make a distinct one for myself you do not have to do that so we'll come back here and then we're going to do text file and the VG sales we're going to open that up and when it pulls up right here you can bring in other tables and then you can start to join them together and create those relationships we're not going to be doing that in this video we'll do that in a separate one as for you know just getting started you know we're not going to be using that but you can see some of these things or some of these fields and if you notice they they um they're either ABC or they're a number so it starts to categorize what this field type is so is it a string is it numeric it starts to automatically do that and that's all done within tablo and so it just kind of reads it and that's what it does um what we're going to do is when I click right down here it's called go to worksheet um the worksheet is where you're going to actually start being able to build your visualizations your charts your graphs all these things um and so you know we have this in here now and so we're just going to click right here on go to worksheet as you can see here is vg sales underscore one you will not have the underscore one if you did not add that like I did uh but right down here you can see all the fields that we just imported from that dataset and they even created one right here for us uh they just generated that field uh based on the file so it's a count of all the rows really so what I'm going to do is I'm just going to walk you through uh basically what we're looking at some of the things that we're going to be using today there were only things that I don't talk about but I'm going to highlight those in set in in future videos when we start using those are going over them um and so let's just start with the most obvious one it's way over here I'm sure you saw it when we uh this first came up on the screen because it has all these different charts and visualizations and graphs and uh these will become available as you start dragging and dropping our data into this sheet and so if I go right here it says four scatter plots try zero or more dimensions two to four measures so what our dimensions are right here what our measures are are right down here and so typically uh things like like you say genre or names or or strings like that are going to be these uh dimensions and then a lot of a lot of times the numerical is going to be are going to be measures next what I want to show you is right here so you can take something like global sales and you can drag it right here into your rows and then it takes your rows and so it automatically created a sum of global sales now if we take that away let's say we drag it right here it's going to give us a column now you can also do it right up here you don't have to um drag it on screen you can also just add it to the column or the row that's typically what I do I it's just more intuitive to me um or you can drop it in this section right here and it does its best to assign it some type of um some type of visualization and so that's what it always is trying to do it is trying to say okay this is what you're trying to do let me try to get the best visualization for the data that you're giving me now while we are here um it went down here into marks and marks is a very important area it's where you can add color, size, text, detail and tooltip and I'm not going to go into what all those arcs I'm just going to show you so let's start pulling some fields in here and creating a visualization and then I'm going to show you how all of that works including filters as well so the first thing that we are going to look at is global sales and let's put that in the rows and then I'm going to take year and I'm going to make that the column and this is basically exactly what I wanted to do now as of right now it has only the year and it's looking at global sales for everything but we want to break that out a little bit better I want to break it out by let's do genre so different genre of games now if I add that right here to this columns it is going to break it up by year and genre if I add it right here is going to break it out by the year of course but then in each individual row has the different genre that's not what we want we want to keep this type of line graph and what we're going to do is we're going to add it to marks and you can't really see it based off of these colors but they're all different so we have action genre we have the sports genre racing role-flying all these different genres with edit now we can get rid of that because we don't need it anymore and this is where these these marks really come in handy because you can start basically doing what you want with them so for the genre I want to be able to see all these different genres with different colors to me that just makes the most sense I want to put color right here and automatically it assigns every single genre its own color and gives us this legend right over here and so it's really easy to see well when you have smaller numbers as much easier but I know that red is sports and I can go right here and find red and that is sports so it makes it a lot easier than when it is all the same color blue so what you can do after that is you can also add things like a label to it so if we take label and we we take genre put label you can click right here and you can get rid of these labels that you have and you can see them right down here or you can also change the font so if you want to make it orange or whatever color you can do all the same things and you can also do things like changing where you see these things so for action you're going to see the time because for each year action is at the is on the higher end and so you're seeing those in those min and maxes you can also do it for a selected area so if I come in here and I select it it's then going to show me what those are so label is really really useful really helpful let me get rid of that really quick and you can also do it where the lines end so line ends is at the beginning and the end and you can also take that away or put that back on so labels are really important labels aren't very helpful when you're doing at least I don't find that it's super helpful when you're doing things like genre so when you're doing your dimensions so I'm going to get rid of that and I'm actually going to our global sales over here and let's label that and right now I think it's labeling the line ends we want to do the min and max now if we do min and max on the table it's just going to give us the max and the min which is zero and then 139.4 it's a little bit more useful if we do it for each line this at least gives us some context I probably wouldn't do this in an actual visualization but to give you some understanding of just how it works so now I know that right over here the min and the max or the min sorry the max for these for action and for sports as right around 138 139 so it's pretty easy to see and you can again go in here and you can remove the max or remove the min which everyone you feel is best you'll probably keep the maximums in there for each category and so this is a really quickly becoming a pretty usable visualization and it's not the only label that you can add we still are using year over here so we can always drop year in there as well create a label and so now we have let's see for this one is a puzzle genre so we also have the year that it had the maximum sales and so you know just some things that you can do you don't have to add that now let's go up here and we're going to take a look at filters because filters are really important you know if you are making this for a client or you're making this for somebody you want them to be able to filter down to very specific information that they want to see so let's take the platform lots of different platforms as you can see PS4 Xbox if you're familiar with these we'll click all of these and we'll click OK so now this is an option as a filter and all we're going to do is we're going to click on this arrow right here and we're going to say show filter now right now all of them are selected so every single one is being taken into account for this visualization but let's say we come down here and we say OK I don't want to see sales for any of these PS the original PlayStation 2 3 or 4 so I'm going to get rid of this one this one this one and this one and you could immediately see the changes that were happening so now none of the numbers none of those sales are being accounted for and being added to the sum of global sales right here at all so that is just how a filter can work and you can also do that and you can get rid of all of them and you can go in and actually just pick very specific sales so if you only want to see the PlayStation sales you can go in there and do that as well so really really handy filters are things that you at least want to have as an option for most of your your visualizations at least that's what I found especially when you're doing client facing work they like to get in there and mess around and look at different look at it in different ways and so that's one that I think is is really useful to to have the very last thing that we want to do is we want to actually add this to a dashboard now let's say we come right down here and we add a new worksheet and actually we might change one more thing on that last one but we'll just make a really simple one we'll just give it genre and we'll give it global sales as the rows and this nifty button right up here which is a sorting button so I'm going to sort like that I'm going to add the genre in just as we did I'll give it different colors perfect now we have two really quick different visualizations right what I want to do is just show you how to combine those because what you are going to do is you're going to actually come in here and you're going to do new dashboard that's what this button is right here now when we come in here the size is extremely small that's very easy to fix that all we're going to do is click right here we're going to go to this range of this drop down and we're going to click automatic so now it is a much larger size for us to actually drop our visualizations into and let's put sheet one and we'll put let's put it up top so now it looks a little bit like this not perfect but again if I wanted to make this look a lot better I definitely would and then you can go over here and you can rename these things you can also do that back when we were in our actual work sheets but you can also do it here as well and then start you know customizing and building it out that's not what this video's for that is the last video we're going to build entire dashboard it'll be kind of like a small project you can put that in your portfolio if you have gotten this far and you want to jump straight into it and you don't want to wait for these other videos to come out or you don't you just want to jump straight into creating an entire portfolio project I have an entire portfolio project series with that cover sequel Python and Tableau and so go check out that series I have one video dedicated to Tableau it's like 45 minutes or an hour long and it covers a lot of the things that we're going to hear in here as well as a few other things but I appreciate you checking out this video in future videos when you're going over things like creating bins calculated fields doing joins and then creating a final project and putting it all together so thank you so much for joining me I really appreciate it if you like this video be sure to like and subscribe below and I will see you in the next video
