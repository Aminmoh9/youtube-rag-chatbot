 What's going on everybody welcome back to another video today when we starting our Python tutorial series. Now I am extremely excited for this series we're going to be walking through all the things that you need to know to get started in Python. We'll be looking at variables, data types, for loops, why loops, operators and a ton more. After this beginner series we're going into another set of series where we look at pandas, matplotlib, seaborin, web scraping, and more. Now in this video we're just going to be setting up our environment to where we can learn Python in future videos. In this series we're going to be using Jupyter notebooks for all of our tutorials because I feel like it's a really great place to learn the basics but then in future videos I'll show you different IDEs that you can use for your Python code. I genuinely cannot wait to get started on this series. I absolutely love Python so without further ado, let's jump on my screen. I'm going to show you how to install Jupyter notebooks. All right so let's get started by downloading anaconda. Anaconda is an open source distribution of Python in our products. So within anaconda is our Jupyter notebooks as well as a lot of other things but we're going to be using it for our Jupyter notebooks. So let's go right down here and if I hit download it's going to download for me because I'm on Windows but if you want additional installers if you're running on Mac or Linux then you can get those all right here. Now if you are running on Windows just make sure to check your system to see if it's a 32 bit or a 64 you can go into your about in your system settings to find that information. I'm going to click on this 64 bit. It's going to pop up on my screen right here and I'm going to click save. Now it's going to start downloading it. It says it could take a little while but honestly it's going to take probably about two to three minutes and then we'll get going. Now that it's done I'm just going to click on it and it's going to pull up this window right here. We are just going to click next because we want to install it. This is our license agreement you can read through this if you would like. I will not. I'm just going to click I agree. Now we can select our installation type and you can either select it for just me or if you have multiple admin or users on one laptop you can do that as well. For me it's just me so I'm going to use this one as it recommends. Now I'm going to show you where it's installing it on your computer. This is the actual file path. It's going to take about 3.5 gigs of space. I have plenty of space but make sure you have enough space and then once you do you can come right over here to next. Now we can do some advanced options. We can add an account of three to my path environment variable and when you're using Python you typically have a default path with whatever Python IDE or notebook that you're using. I use a lot of Visual Studio code so if I do this I'm worried it might mess something up so I am not going to do this. It also says it doesn't recommend it. Again messing with these paths is kind of something that you might want to do once you know more about Python so I don't really recommend you having this checked. We can also register in a kind of three as my default Python 3.9. You can do this one and I'm going to keep it this way just so I have the exact same settings as you do. So let's go ahead and click install and now it is going to actually install this on your computer. Now once that's complete we can hit next and now we're going to hit next again and finally we're going to hit finish but if you want to you can have this tutorial and this getting started with Anaconda. I don't want either of them because I don't need them but if you would like to have those if this checked and you can get those let's click finish. Now let's go down and we're going to search for Anaconda and I'll say Anaconda Navigator and we're going to click on that and it should open up for us. So this is what you should be seeing on your screen. This is the Anaconda Navigator and this is where that distribution of Python and R is going to be. So we have a lot of different options in here and some of them may look familiar. We have things like Visual Studio Code, Spider, our studio and then right up here we have our Jupyter notebooks and this is what we're going to be using throughout our tutorials. So let's go ahead and click on launch and this is what should kind of pop up on your screen. Now I've been using this a lot so I have a ton of notebooks and files in here but if you are just now seeing this it might be completely blank or just have some default folders in here but this is where we're going to open up a new Jupyter notebook where we can write code and all of the things that we're going to be learning in future tutorials and you can use this area to save things and create folders and organize everything. If you already have some notebooks from previous projects or something you can upload them here but what we're going to do is go right to this new. We're going to click on the drop down and we're going to open up a Python 3 kernel and so we're going to open this up right here. Now right here is where we're going to be spending 99% of our time in future videos. This is where we're going to write all of our code. So right here is a cell and this is where we can type things so I can say print, I can do the famous hello world and then I'll run that by clicking shift enter and this is where all of our code is going to go. These are called cells so each one of these are a cell and we have a ton of stuff up here and I'm going to get to that in just a second but one thing I want to show you is that you don't only have to write code here you can also do something called markdown and so markdown is its own kind of you can say language but it's just a different way of writing especially within notebook. So all we're going to do is do this little hashtag and I think it's a pound side but I'm going to call it hashtag. I'm going to do that. I'm going to say first notebook and then if I run that we have our first notebook and we can make little comments a little notes like that that don't actually run any code they just kind of organize things for us and I'm going to do that in a lot of our future videos so I just wanted to show you how to do that. Now let's look right up here a lot of these things are pretty important. One of the first things that's really important is actually saving this. So let's say we wanted to change the title to I'm going to do a a a because I want it to be at the beginning so I can show you this. I'm going to a new notebook and I'm going to rename it and then I'm going to save that. So if I go right back over here you can see a a new notebook that green means that it's currently running and when I say running I mean right up here and if we wanted to we go ahead and shut that down which means it wouldn't run the code anymore and then we'd have to run up a new cluster. So let's go ahead and do that I plan on doing that but let's do it so we have no notebooks running and right here it says we have a dead kernel so this was our Python 3 kernel and now since I stopped it it's no longer processing anything so let's go ahead and say try restarting now and it says kernel is ready so it's back up and running and we're good to go. The next thing is this button right here now this is an insert cell below so if I have a lot of code I know I'm going to be writing I can click a lot of that and I often do that because I just don't like having to do that all the time so I make a bunch of cells just so I can use them you can also delete cells so see we have some code here we'll say here and we have code here and then we have this empty cell right here we can just get rid of that by doing this cut selected cells we can also copy selected cells so if I hit copy selected cells and I can go right here and say paste selected cells and as you can see it pasted that exact same cell you can also move this up and down so I can actually take this one and say I wanted it in this location I can take this cell and move it up or I can move it down and that's just an easy way to kind of organize it instead of having to like copy this and moving it right down here and pasting it you can just take this cell and move it up which is really nice now earlier when I ran this code right here I hit shift enter you can also run and it'll run the cell below so you can hit run and it works properly if you're running a script and it's taking forever and it's not working properly at least it's you don't think it's working properly you can stop that by doing this interrupt the kernel right here and anything you're trying to do within this kernel if it's just not working properly it'll stop it you can restart it then you can try fixing your code you can also hit this button if you want to restart your kernel and this button if you want to restart the kernel and then rerun the entire notebook as we talked about just a second ago we have our code and our markdown code we're not going to talk about either of these because we're not going to use that throughout the entire series the next thing I want to show you is right up here if you open this file we can create a new notebook we can open an existing notebook we can copy it save it rename it all that good stuff we can also edit it so a lot of these things that we were talking about you can cut the cells and copy the cells using these shortcuts if you would like to we also go to view and you can toggle a lot of these things if you would like to which just means it'll show it or not show it depending on what you want so if we toggle this toolbar it'll take away the toolbar for us or if we go back and we toggle the toolbar we can bring it back we can also insert a few different things like inserting a cell above or a cell below so instead of saying this plus button you can just say a or b routing above or below we also have the cell in which we can run ourselves or run all of them or all above or all below and then we have our kernels right here which we were talking about earlier where we can interrupt it and restart those there are widgets we're not going to be looking at any widgets in this series but if it's something you're interested in you can definitely do that then we have help so if you are looking for some help on any of these things especially some of these references which are really nice you can use those and you can also edit your own keyboard shortcuts and now that we walk through all of that you know have anaconda and Jupyter notebooks installed on your computer in future videos this is where we're going to be writing all of our Python code so be sure to check those out so we can learn Python together thank you guys so much for watching I hope you were able to get everything installed correctly I am super excited for this series ahead of us if you like this video be sure to like and subscribe below and I will see you in the next video
