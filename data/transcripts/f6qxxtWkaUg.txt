 What's going on everybody welcome back to the tablo tutorial series in this video we're going to be going over bins and calculated fields. Alright so let's jump right into it the first thing that we're going to look at are bins and bins are basically just groupings or ranges of numerical values. So we cannot create bins for genre name platform or anything like that we have to do something with this sign right here which means that it is a numeric. So year or all of the sales data or this ranking data and we're going to use what we worked on in our very first tutorial. And so what we're going to be using to kind of demonstrate how bins work is this year right down here. So right now we have a range of 1993 all the way up to 2018 and we're going to create some bins to group and create ranges for these years. And it's pretty simple all we're going to do is we're going to come right over here to year and this little drop down on the side and we're going to go down to create and go down to bins. Now it's going to say the size of bin and it's going to give you a recommendation based off of the information that is already provided the min and the max of the ranges of these values. You know you don't have to do this but usually it does give some good estimation on what you might be considering if you were thinking hey maybe do a bit of like 20 and they're recommending to think about why they might be doing that. We're going to change ours to five and you can always change what this field is going to be i'm just going to give it an old exclamation point just to really spice things up here. So we're going to click OK and as you can see it adds it right up here is no longer it is no longer a numeric now it is a categorical so it now it's this is no longer just one two three four five it's ranges its groups. And we're going to get rid of this year really quick actually let's keep it up there for a second see what happens but we're going to bring this up and we'll get rid of this year and this is is what kind of it spits out for us. Now I did look at the data when I was prepping for this there are some nils in the years and so all we're going to do for this is we're just going to go like this and we're going to exclude the nils. Probably not something you should be doing if you're doing this for work this is for demonstration purposes so we can do it every one. But as you can see we now have these ranges so this range starts at 1990 and it includes 1990 all the way up to 1994 and then it's 1995 to 1999. And so just really quickly we can tell that the years 2000 to 2004 were a huge huge huge season or group of years for game sales so these are the global sales for for these video games. And so it is really helpful it's very useful you can do this on a lot of different information we could do this on the sales data you can do this on age you can do it on years like we did and it can be very very useful and so really quickly that is how bins work I would say it's pretty straight forward. Now this is a perfect time to segue into the next part of the video which is calculated fields right over here on this left hand side we see that the global sales which are in millions goes all the way up to 900 million and created these beautiful bins right down here. But let's look at within these from 1999 to 2015 let's see which of these has the highest percentage of course it's going to be this one but we can do something called a quick table calculation will create a our own calculation later I'll show you how to do that. But we're going to do a quick table calculation and we're going to do the percent of total. And so now we have these bins and instead of just seeing the total amount of sales that they had we see the actual percentages based off these year ranges which is really useful something that you could absolutely put in some real work that you do for a client now really quick just to show you something that you can do if you click control and you drag this over here. You can actually save that calculation so we can say percentage of global sales and that actually saves it as you know a measure for us so that was a quick calculation but let's look how to actually create a calculated field. So if you do this right here what is going to come up is just the global sales and you can do a lot of what you would basically do in Excel multiplication division subtraction a few other things but we're going to keep it super super simple today all I'm going to do is I'm going to take global sales and I'm going to subtract I'm going to open bracket and I'm going to say EU sales and it auto completes for me I'm going to click OK and it created calculation to I'm going to come in here and I'm just going to say global sales. Global sales minus EU sales and let's drag this over these are different once percentage one is in terms of some and so I'm just going to bring this in right here and so now we are comparing against the same thing and if we look at the global sales we have probably right around 950 million ish in this 2000 to do you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this again. So I'm going to do this in this 2000 to 2004 bin and for global sales minus the EU sales we're looking at you know 650 million so there is a noticeable difference and this is just one of the ways that you can use calculated fields to actually just show the difference between two numbers or you can do more advanced calculations depending on the data that you actually have. So I'm going to put it for this video I hope you learned a little bit more about bins and calculated fields in the next video we're going to be looking at a ton of different visualizations and graphs and charts and just exploring what options are really are out there for visualizing our data.
