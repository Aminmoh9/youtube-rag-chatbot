    "text": "What's going on everybody? Today we are going to be starting our MySQL tutorial series. Now the entire MySQL series will be broken up in three smaller series. We'll have our beginner, our intermediate, and our advanced. This lesson is the very first lesson in the beginner series, where we're going to walk through all of the beginner or the basics of MySQL. Today we're going to be setting everything up so we'll be installing MySQL and then creating our database that will use to actually learn MySQL. Now before we get started, I wanted to let you know that I created three full MySQL courses over on analystbuilder.com. I built a crash course for MySQL for people who are going to be interviewing or taking technical interviews. I also created a full MySQL course that's going to cover everything from the basics all the way to the intermediate level. And then lastly, I created an advanced course that's going to teach you a lot of the more advanced things that an analyst would typically use. Those courses are going to go really in depth and they're going to have a lot of practice questions along the way. And we'll also have full guided projects in there as well. I'll have links in the description to all of those courses if you want to check those out. Now without further ado, let's jump on my screen and install MySQL and create our database. All right, so let's get started by downloading MySQL. We're going to come right over here to dev.mySQL.com. Forward slash downloads, forward slash installer. And I will have that link in the description, so you don't have to write all that out. But you should be seeing this page right here. Now we have to select an operating system. I'm using a Windows machine. And if you aren't if you're using Linux or Mac or something else, it should populate it for you. But if it doesn't, just select this drop down and select your operating system. Next, we have two different downloads. We can install the MySQL installer community or MySQL installer web community. This one is very small, but then you actually do have to download the installer. It just gets it from the web. This one I'm going to download the actual installer. It's larger, but this is the one I'm going to do. So I'm going to go ahead and select download. It's going to ask me if I want to log in or create an account. And I don't. I'm going to say no thanks. Just start my download. I'm going to save this in this desktop folder. It doesn't really matter where you save it. We're going to save that. And it's going to download. It should be done in just a few seconds. I'm going to go ahead and click on it. And it's going to open it up when it's finished. And we should get the interface of the UI for the actual installation for MySQL. So here is the MySQL installer. And first thing we need to do is choose a setup type. Now we're going to keep the developer default. Unless you really know what you're doing and you can select the server only, the client only, full, which is literally everything MySQL has to offer or custom. So we're going to keep this developer default just installing the things that we kind of need. So let's go ahead and select next. And for whatever reason on my computer, it's saying this path already exists. You probably won't get that, but I'm just going to go ahead and select next. And then I'll select yes. It keeps doing that. I can't explain why, but it keeps doing that for me, even though I've deleted it from my computer completely. But it just remembers it somewhere in its memory. Now the next thing we need is to check requirements. Now I just have this one. It says I need to download this Visual Studio. I'm not going to do that, but on your screen, you may have multiple multiple requirements. Typically, you're looking at something like this Microsoft Visual C++ redistributable package. What you need to do is download this. I have to do is click download. Once you download and install that on your computer, and then we go back all those should be gone. That's the one that I see the most when I'm actually working with these requirements. I had to install it myself when I got this new laptop. So go ahead and install that if you need to. But if yours looks like mine, we don't need this Visual Studio for what we're going to do. We want to go ahead and select next. It is giving us a prompt that we haven't satisfied all the requirements, but that's okay. We're going to go ahead and select yes as well. Now we're ready to install all of these things. These are all things that my SQL wants you to install. The most important are the server and the workbench, but it does not hurt to have all these other things as well. Some of these connectors are also important. So we're going to go ahead and execute. This will take just a few minutes. I'll skip ahead when they're all done, but this should take just a few minutes and then we'll continue on installing my SQL. So everything just completed and now we're going to select next. And now we need to actually configure our product. Now really the only one that we actually need to configure is the server. The router says we need to configure it in the samples and examples say we need to configure it as well, but really it's just the server. Let's go ahead and select next. Now we're not going to change anything for this type and networking unless you know what you're doing with the port, the export call port. We're not going to change any of this. We'll go ahead and select next. Next thing we need to do is select an authentication method. I'm going to be using a password. I'm not going to be using the legacy authen",

We'll go ahead and select next. Next thing we need to do is select an authentication method. I'm going to be using a password. I'm not going to be using the legacy authentication method. So I'm just going to go ahead and create a password. Now for you and I keep getting this error and I can't explain why right here for you. You should be creating a password at the bottom. It's remembering my password somehow and I really can't explain it. But I'm going to create my password or check my password. This is one that I already created before I deleted it off my computer, but it's still there. So it's saying my password is still good, but if you need to, you should be entering a password and then confirming your password and saving it. And then you should also be checking it as well. And then we're going to configure this as a MySQL server as a Windows service. I'm going to keep that checked. And we're going to start the MySQL server at system startup. I like that automatically being there. I don't want to mess with that. So I'm going to keep it as it has it. We're going to go ahead and select next. And the last thing we do is since need to execute this and then everything we put in there is going to actually go. So let's run this and execute it. And that's just finished. So let's go ahead and select finish. Now it's that configuration complete for the server, but we also need to configure these other two. Let's take a look at these really quickly. We're not going to do anything on this. It even says we really don't need to do this. We just need to click finish and configuration not needed. Next we'll do samples and examples. And we can input our password. And all this is really going to do is put in some sample databases for us in our database, which if you want, you definitely can do that. I just connected that worked. I'm going to hit next and execute. And it's basically just going to put in a database or two, some sample ones for you to look at. And the configuration is complete. You don't have to do that one, but we'll see that in just a second. And we're going to select next. And now the installation is completely done. And we can start my SQL workbench after setup and start my SQL shell after setup. Now I'm not going to do the shell. So I'm going to actually uncheck that and we're going to select finish. Now my SQL just popped up for us. And this is exactly what you should be seeing. Now there's a lot of things in my SQL to learn and know how to do. We're not going to be taking a look at all of that stuff today. But in future lessons, we'll walk through a lot of these different things that kind of correlate with different lessons or things that we're working on in my SQL. The first thing that we're going to click on is right over here. This is our local instance. This is local to just our machine. It's not a connection to, you know, some other database on the cloud or anything like that. It's just our local instance. We're going to go ahead and click on this. So this is what you should be seeing right here. This is where we're going to actually write all of our SQL code and I'll show you all this in just a second. But this is where we can actually create our database. And our database is going to go right over here on this left hand side. This silica one is actually a sample database that has a bunch of tables and views or procedures functions as all these things in here. If you want to go ahead and mess around with that, what we're about to do is create our own database that we're going to be using throughout this entire series, both the beginner, intermediate and advanced. We'll use a lot of this and sometimes we'll import some other ones for different use cases. But this will serve for most of what we're trying to do throughout this entire series. Now, what I'm going to do is I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to say open a SQL script file in a new query tab. And right here, it opened up to a folder that I already created. This MySQL beginner series folder within it. We have this right here, the Parks and Rec create underscore DB. Now, in order to get this, you just have to go to the GitHub and download this file. That's all you have to do. We're then going to open this file. So let's click on it. We're going to say open. And what you're now seeing is basically the query editor. This is where you can write your code. Now, we're not importing a database. We're actually creating it by running code. Now, because this is the first lesson in the beginner series, I'm going to assume that you don't know a ton about MySQL. Really, all this is doing is creating the database name. And then we're inserting a",

Now, because this is the first lesson in the beginner series, I'm going to assume that you don't know a ton about MySQL. Really, all this is doing is creating the database name. And then we're inserting a few tables into that database. And then we're inserting data into those tables. So this is all of our data that will go into these tables that we create. We only have one, two, three different tables that we're going to be using. So all you have to do to run this is click this lightning button right up here. We're going to go ahead and execute this. If we come down to the bottom and we pull this up, this is our output. This says six rows affected. And we have a bunch of other things like create table, create table, insert, insert, create table, insert into these things are all working perfectly. So now if we go ahead and click refresh in our schemas with this refresh button right here, this parks and recreation table is populated. If we go under the tables, we see all of these things. So now that we've actually created our database and our tables, that's really all we were trying to do in this lesson. But I just want to open up a table really quickly, show you what it looks like, show you how we can run code. And then in the next lesson, we'll start actually learning how to query this data. So let's go up to employee demographics. We're going to right click and select rows limit 1000. This is going to open up a new window right up here. And it's going to say select everything from this database. This table employee demographics and it ends with a semicolon. Now right down here, we have this output window. This is the actual data that sits in our table. We have columns right here. So employee ID, first name, last name, age, gender, and birth date. And then here are all of our employees on each row. So these are all separate rows. We have Leslie. Nope. Tom have referred and it goes on and on. So this is all of our data. The most important things to know when we're actually working with this. And I'm going to zoom in is if we hover over this query right here and we run it, we can select this execute, which is this lightning bolt with this eye. We're going to execute this and it's going to run this because we're highlighted over it. Now if we have two queries, let's say this one right here, but let's change it to employee underscore salary. We'll do underscore salary. Let's say we want to query this table. So now if we highlight over this and we go up and select the light and bolt with the eye. Now we're looking at a different table. But if we select even if we're hovering over this, if we selected this button, we're going to execute everything in this editor window. So let's run this. And now you can see at the bottom, we have two outputs, the employee demographics and the employee salary. So this button is going to run everything in this editor window. Whereas if we select this lightning bolt with the eye, we're doing everything that's just under where we have the cursor where we have it highlighted. The very last thing that I want to mention is that right over here, you may have this up and you probably don't want that. We're not going to do any SQL additions in the series. You can get rid of that by clicking this button right here. So starting in the next lesson, we'll have everything ready to go and we will start learning the basics of my SQL. I hope you're able to follow along, get everything set up how we have it on the screen. I am super excited about this series. I just I love SQL. So I'm really, really, really excited to get started on this with you guys. I will see you guys in the next lesson",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson we're going to be learning about the select statement in my SQL. The select statement is used to work with columns and specify what columns you want to see in your output. The first thing that we need to do is open up a tab or an editor window. So let's go right up here to the left hand side and we're going to create a new tab and I'm going to zoom in just a little. Now what we need to do is we need to select the actual table that we're going to be querying off of. If you remember from the very first lesson when we set everything up, we came over here and we right-clicked and did select rows limit 1000. We're not going to do that, we're going to actually write it out. So what we need to do to select that table, the employee demographics table, is we need to select everything. That's what this star means. This star means everything. All tables, all rows. Now we do have a limit on here. We have a limit to 1000 rows. So if we had a table that had 50,000 rows, this limiter would be an issue. It would still limit it to 1000 rows. We would have to change that to 2000, 5000, probably all the way up to 50,000 if we wanted to view everything. If we had to say a million rows, we would need to come up here and say don't limit, and it would give us a million rows. The reason they do this is mostly to keep the processing time low. If you have a million rows, it's going to take a long time for the output to actually appear. Let's come right back here. The next thing that we need to do is we need to say select everything, and now we need to say where we're selecting it from. So we're going to come right down here, and we're going to say from, and now we need to specify what table. And we're going to say employee underscore demographics. And at the end, we need a semicolon. Now why do we need a semicolon? This is going to tell my SQL that this is the end of this query. So if you read another one down here, which we will in just a second, it'll be able to distinguish between the two queries. We're going to go ahead and we're going to run this, and we'll just use this execute right here, instead of this one. And there we have our entire table. So we were able to get our table. Now, there is one thing that is potentially wrong, depending on what you're using it for. But what we didn't do is we did not specify the actual database before it. We only specified the table. In this works perfectly fine, because if you look over here on this left hand side, we have parks and recreation. It's in black. It's bold. That means that we're hitting off of this database. What's going to happen though if we gum down here to the SIS database and we double-click on it. Now this database is highlighted. So now when we're selecting this table, we're trying to select this table from the SIS database. Let's go ahead and try this. If you notice, we have no output. Let's come right down here and pull this up. It's going to say employee sys.employee underscore demographics doesn't exist. So it's assuming that we're highlighting this SIS database. That means we're trying to pull from that database. Now we can still have this highlighted and still select the correct database by saying parks underscore and underscore recreation. Let me spell that right. So now we're selecting everything from parks and recreation.employee demographics. If we run this, we do get the correct output. That's just something to consider, especially when you're working with a lot of databases and a lot of tables. It's usually best practice to actually put the database in front of the table name. Although throughout this lesson, we probably won't be doing that every time since we're only going to be using this parks and recreation database. Let's go ahead and double-click this. So we have this highlighted again. Let's click all of this. Let's copy all of this. We're going to come down just a little bit right here. Now so far, we've only selected everything, but we don't have to do that. We can actually just select one column if we would like to. For example, if we got rid of that star, we say first underscore name. We're selecting the first name column from this table. If we highlight this query and we hit the execute button with the i, now we are only going to return in our output all of the first names. And we can add a lot more. Let's actually look at all these. We can separate multiple columns with a comma. So we can do first name, comma, last underscore name, and then we can do birth underscore date. So now we have three separate columns. Let's go ahead and run this. And now we have first name, last name, and birth date in our output. Now the way we just wrote it is all on one line. And that's perfectly acceptable because my SQL is going to read it the exact same as if we did it in a different format as lo",

And that's perfectly acceptable because my SQL is going to read it the exact same as if we did it in a different format as long as it's still in this order. But sometimes you'll see it like this where it's select first name, comma, last name, comma, birth date, all on different rows. Now there's a lot of different use cases for this or reasons for this, but it typically can be easier to read. Also, if you're doing any type of functions or calculations in the select statement, it's easier to separate those out on its individual row. Now again, we won't always be doing this, but it does help sometimes if you're doing that, it just makes it easier to visualize. For example, if we added the age, so let's add age in here. Let's run this. Let's say we were doing a calculation where we wanted to add, you know, 10 years to their age. So we'll say age and we'll actually create a new row for this or new column. We'll do age plus 10. So now we can easily see that we're doing plus 10 here. And this is another thing that you can do in the select statement, things like calculations. So if we go up here and we run this, we'll now have an age column, but we're also have an age plus 10 column where it just adds 10 to the age. And we can at least visualize and really easily see this when we're doing these calculations. Now something really important to know about any type of calculations, any math within my SQL is that it follows the rules of PEMDOS. Now PEMDOS is written like this. It's PMDS. Now what I just did right here with this pound or this hashtag is actually create a comment. So this code isn't going to actually run, but it's just for note taking or seeing things in your actual editor window. I'll come back to comments in just a second, but just wanted to explain what that was. Now what PEMDOS is is the order of operations for arithmetic or math within my SQL. This stands for parentheses, exponent, multiplication, division, addition, and subtraction. So this is the order that these calculations are going to run in the execution engine that my SQL has. So if I do age plus 10, and we'll put that all in parentheses, and then we come over here and we add times 10. So we're doing plus 10 here, and then a times 10 here. What's going to actually happen is it's going to say age plus 10. So 44 plus 10 equals 54. Then we're multiplying times 10. The parentheses execute first because it comes first in this order. parentheses. Multiplication comes next because it's this one. And then anything else after that, if we did, you know, plus 10 could run this. And you'll notice that it still follows the logic. 10 was just added at the very end to all of these outputs. Now let's go right back up here. Let's select everything again from this table. Let's pull up this table so we can see it a little better. And let's go down because the last thing that I want to show you is something called distinct. Now this is really, really useful and you use this a lot in my SQL. What distinct is going to do is it's going to select only the unique values within a column. Let's go ahead and copy this employee demographics. Bring it right down here. Let's say select. Let's do first underscore name. So now we're just selecting the first name. Let's come right down here. There we go. So now we're selecting just the first name from this column. Now these are all unique values. So if we come right here and we say distinct, nothing should happen to this table because these are all unique values. Let's go ahead and run this. As you can see the output looks exactly the same. But what if we reduce something like gender? So let's come here. Let's do gender. Let's run this keeps going down. I don't know why it's doing that. But now we have male and female. Now these are not all unique. We have female female female female the rest are males. So there's only two unique values here. So if we come right here, we say distinct gender. Now there should only be two in the output male and female. Let's go",

Now there should only be two in the output male and female. Let's go ahead and run this. So now we get male and female in our output. Now this works perfectly in one column. But what happens if we have two columns? So let's do first underscore name comma gender. Let's go and run this. Now the combination of first name and gender are no longer unique. Now Leslie and female are being grouped together. And it's taking the distinct between both of these columns. So when we're only working with gender, it's only looking at this one column for both male and female. So it reduces it down to the only two unique values. But because we add the first name, all of these values are unique. So therefore the name plus the gender combination is always going to be unique. The very last thing that I want to show you in this lesson doesn't actually pertain to the select statement. But I want to save this code. Let's say we wanted to update this or upload this into our GitHub or save this and send it to somebody. We can do that. We can save it by clicking this save button right here. I'm going to go ahead and click this. And now we're in our MySQL beginner series folder. I'm just going to save this and I can save this as anything I want. So I'm going to say two dot select statement tutorial. So now when I save this, you'll notice that the name gets changed up here to two dot select statement tutorial. Let's exit out of this. I'm going to open up and now I'm going to come here to the select statement tutorial. I'm going to open it and now I have our code again, exactly as we had it written before. I just wanted to show that to you in case you wanted to save your code as you go throughout the series because that's usually what I do when I'm working with this stuff or learning these things, I like to save my code as I go along. So with that being said, that is the end of the select statement. In the next lesson, we're going to be learning about the where statement where we can actually filter our data.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at the where clause. The where clause is used to help filter our records or our rows of data, whereas the select statement is used to help filter or select actual columns. So when we're using the where clause, we're only going to return the rows that fulfill a specific condition. Let's take a look at exactly how this works. Let's say we come right up here. We're going to say where. Let's go down with that one. Let's say where and now we need to specify what column we're about to create this condition for. So we're going to say first underscore name. So we're saying where the first name will say is equal to and let's do quotes and let's say Leslie. So we're saying the first name has to be equal to this value right here, which is Leslie for Leslie. Nope. If we run this, there's only going to be one row that's returned because Leslie is the only Leslie in this entire table. So we just used an equal sign and that's actually called a comparison operator. And there's a few other comparison operators that you can use. Let's take a look at some of these other ones. Let's pull this down right down here and let's actually highlight the select from. And we're going to run it with this one right here. It's going to only select everything from the whole table. So we didn't select that where clause. Let's go right down here and let's look at this salary field. So I'm going to say where the salary and I'm going to do a different comparison operator called greater than. So when the salary is greater than 50,000. Now one thing I want to note before we actually run this is that right down here we have Tom Havafford makes exactly 50,000. And I think there's one more Jerry Gurgich, which also makes exactly 50,000. If we run this, you'll notice that both Tom and Jerry are not in this output. But in the salary field, everything is greater than 50,000. The reason for that is that Tom and Jerry made exactly 50,000. What we're saying right here is where the salary is only greater than. If we want to include Tom and Jerry, we have to say greater than or equal to. And now we'll select 50,000 or above. Whereas right here, before we were doing just this, it was greater than 50. It didn't include the 50,000. Let's go ahead and include it and run this. And now you'll notice that Tom and Jerry were both included because they have exactly 50,000 and we said greater than or equal to. And we could do the exact same thing but with less than. So we have less than 50,000. And now we only have two people who make less than 50,000. That's April and Andy. And if we say less than or equal to and we run that, now we include both Tom and Jerry who make exactly 50,000. So it's less than or equal to 50,000 dollars. Now what we're going to do is head on over to a different table. We're going to do the demographics table. Make sure I spell that right. And that's our semicolon. Let's run this. And what we want to look at is the gender really quick. So we're going to say where the gender is equal to, we'll do in quotes, female. And if we run this, we get all the genders that are equal to female. But we do have something called the not equal to and it looks like this. It's an exclamation point and an equal sign. This is going to say where the gender is not equal to female. So if we run this, you'll notice that the gender is all male now. So far we've worked with things like integers, which are numbers. We've worked with characters or strings like names. But there's a different type of data type as well in here. We have a date column for these birth dates. Now in the where clause, we can also filter on birth dates. Let's come over here and we'll say birth underscore date. Let's say it's greater than and within quotes, we'll say 1985 dash 01 dash 01. This is kind of a standard default date format within my SQL, which is year, month and day. If we go ahead and run this, we can also take all the people who are greater than or born greater than 1985. So all of these dates are greater than 1985. Now the next thing that I want to take a look at is logical operators in the where clause. So logical operators and things like and or and not. Now these are called and let's add this logical operators. So logical operators allow us to have different logic. And let's take a look at how this works. Exactly. Let's copy this down because we already have",

Now the next thing that I want to take a look at is logical operators in the where clause. So logical operators and things like and or and not. Now these are called and let's add this logical operators. So logical operators allow us to have different logic. And let's take a look at how this works. Exactly. Let's copy this down because we already have this one written out. We're saying where the birth date is greater than 1985. We can also say where the gender is equal to male. So we can say and gender is equal. And then we'll say male. So we're adding a different complexity or an additional conditional statement within our where clause. Let's go ahead and run this. So now we're only selecting birth dates that are greater than 1985 and where the gender is equal to male. Only the rows that fulfill both of those are returned. Now the and says both this and this have to be true. But we could change this. We could say or what this means is either this one has to be changed. Or this one has to be true in order for it to be returned. So let's go ahead and run this. You'll notice that Jerry Gurgich was born much before 1985. But since he has a male gender, he is in our output. And we could also use the not operator by saying or not gender equal to male. So now what this is saying is the birth date could be greater than 1985 or it could not be equal to male, which is female. So if you look at Leslie Nope, she was born before 1985, but because she is female, she is in the output. Now like we talked about in the last lesson, there is something called Pemdos and that actually applies to these logical operators as well. So if we run this entire table, let's go ahead and run this. If we're looking at this entire table, let's say we want to get someone very, very specific. Let's say we're going to do where the first underscore name is equal to Leslie and their age has to be equal to 44. That's extremely specific and we can actually just do it like this. We don't need quotes for integers. We could just do the number if we'd like to. This is very specific. There's only one person. But if we put this in parentheses, we can add an or over here. We could say, or the age is greater than, let's just do 55. Let's go ahead and run this and then we'll take a look at it. So within these parentheses, we have an and operator. What that means is both this condition has to be met and this condition has to be met. That's only one person. That's Leslie. But then outside of these parentheses, we have another conditional statement or the age is greater than 55. So what we're saying within these parentheses is that this is an isolated conditional statement within these parentheses, if this is true, then in our output, it'll be returned. But then we have an or a condition which says, or someone with the age of greater than 55 can also be in the output. So these parentheses can be really helpful when you're actually using it in the where clause with these and ors and nuts. Now, I want to take a look at just one more thing and let's bring this down here. And let's get rid of this entire thing. Now the last thing that we're going to take a look at is a like statement. Now the like statement is super unique because we can look for specific patterns. We're not necessarily looking for an exact match. Like here, if we said where first underscore name is equal to Jerry. If we're looking for Jerry, it has to be exactly Jerry. But if we take this out, say J, R, and then we run it, we get no output. It has to be an exact match. But here's where the like statement comes in because we can actually say like J, E, R, and we can add two special sequences or special characters within our like statement. So those special characters are the percent sign and the underscore. The percent sign means anything and the underscore means a specific value. Let's see how that actually works",

So those special characters are the percent sign and the underscore. The percent sign means anything and the underscore means a specific value. Let's see how that actually works. So what we're going to do is we're going to say like J, R, percent sign. That's the first one in this like statement. What this says is the first name is like starting with J, R, but that has anything after it. It doesn't matter what it is. As long as it has J, R at the very beginning, it will be returned. Let's go ahead and run this. Now the only person who starts with J, R is Jerry. But what if I took the J out of here now it's saying it starts with E, R, and that's not anybody. What we can do is we can add another percent at the beginning. This is going to say anything comes before anything comes after all we're looking for is E, R somewhere in their name. Let's go ahead and run this. There's still only one person and that's Jerry. Now let's come up here and let's get rid of this. Let's say we're looking for everyone's name who starts with A. We do that really easily by saying A, percent sign. All that says is it starts with A. We don't have a percent sign before it, which would say this string just has to have an A somewhere in it. If we have it like this, this means an A has to come at the beginning. Let's go ahead and run this. In our output, we have April and an Andy. Now let's take a look at the underscore. If we get rid of this percent sign and we do two underscores, one, two, this is going to say it starts with an A that has two characters after it. No more, no less. If we run this and is going to be the only person who's returned because she has an A and then two characters after it. If we want Andy, we can specify that by doing another underscore. That's one, two, three. Now Andy is the only one in our output. Now there was also April there, but she had more than three characters, but we can actually get her in our output by doing a percent sign. We can combine both the underscore and the percent sign. This is going to say it starts with an A as one, two, three characters, and then it can have anything after that. It just has to have at least an A and have one, two, three characters after it. Let's run it. I can see April comes into here because she does have A. The P, R, and I are the three next characters, but then we have a percent sign that allows that L to be in the output as well. Now we don't just have to do this with strings or text like April and Andy. We could also do this with birth dates. For example, Andy's birth date is 1989. We could say where the birth underscore date is like, let's say we want to look at everyone who is 1989 or born in 1989. Let's go and run this. Andy's the only person born in 1989, but again, we looked at the year at the very beginning. That is how the like statement works. It looks for a specific sequence within that column that you can search for. It doesn't have to be an exact match as long as it has that specified sequence that you've put in there anywhere within that cell or that column. That is everything that we're going to look at for the wear clause. In the next lesson, we're going to take a look at the group by and the order by within my sequel.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson we're going to be taking a look at group by and order by in my SQL. Now when you use the group by clause in my SQL it's going to group together rows that have the same values in the specified column or columns that you're actually grouping on. Once you group those rows together you can run something called an aggregate function on those rows. Let's see how this actually works. Let's go ahead and copy this right here. We'll bring that down and let me go back up one. Let's go ahead and write gender right here. Now we want to group on this gender column and we're going to say group by gender. Let's go ahead and run this. We'll see what we get. And so we have male and female. Now we could get the exact same output by saying select distinct gender from this table. What is group by doing that the gender actually isn't doing? Well it's actually rolling up all of these values into these rows. So later when we run aggregate functions like average, min, max, we'll do it based off of these rows and all those rows are rolled up into these two rows and we'll see that in a little bit. Now what if I was to come up here and in this demographics we have a first underscore name. What would happen if I'm selecting the first name but I'm grouping it by the gender. Let's go ahead and run this. If we come right down here we pull this up. You can see that the select list is not in group by clause and contains non-aggregated columns. What this means is that when you are selecting a column, if it's not an aggregated column like say average of something, if we're not using that aggregate functions in the select statement, it has to be in the group by these have to match. So this gender has to match this group by if we're not performing an aggregate function on it. Let's go ahead and run this and now it works properly. Now let's go back up. Let's run this query because I want to select everything again. Well let's say we wanted to take a look at the average ages for gender. So what we're going to do is we're selecting gender. We're also grouping by gender but what we're going to do is add a comma and we'll say the average that's AVG that stands for average and then we're going to put in here age. So now this right here is an aggregate function. This does not need to go in the group by. We're just grouping on the gender and then we're performing this aggregate function or kind of a calculation based off of those grouped rows for gender. So let's go ahead and run this and take a look at the output. So what this is telling me is that for the males, all of the male rows that were grouped, the average age is 41. Let's say three and for female, the average age is 38.5. So super quickly you can tell that the average age of females is lower than the average age of males. Now we'll take a look at aggregate functions more in just a little bit. Let's actually go to a different table. Let's come right down here. We're going to go to the salary table and just select everything for now. Let's go ahead and run this. Now what we're going to actually be grouping on is this occupation right here. Now there's a lot of unique values. It's not as distinct as the gender which only had two values. You'll notice we do have a few that are the same. We have ones like office manager. So when we come up here, let's say occupation and of course we need to group by the occupation as well. Now let's run this. You'll notice that office manager only has one row. Let's say we also want to group on the salary. Let's say salary. Now we can group on multiple. So we're going to say salary like this. So we're grouping on the occupation as well as the salary. Now let's run this. You'll notice that we have two rows for office manager now. This is because this salary and this salary for those two employees are different. We have 50,000 and 60,000. For this, I just wanted to demonstrate that if these had both been 50,000, there would only be one row. Office manager 50,000. But because this is a unique value, different than 50,000, they have their own individual rows which we would then perform our aggregate calculations on. Let's go and get rid of that because we will not be using that anymore. I just wanted to demonstrate it really quickly. So before we were looking at gender and average age and we're also grouping on the gender, we can perform other aggregate functions as well. Let's take a look at some of those. We could look at the max age as well. The max is going to show us the highest value within each of those groupings. So we have a mal",

So before we were looking at gender and average age and we're also grouping on the gender, we can perform other aggregate functions as well. Let's take a look at some of those. We could look at the max age as well. The max is going to show us the highest value within each of those groupings. So we have a male and female. The max age for those for the male is 61 and the highest age for the female is 46. We did the exact same thing. Exactly if we could say min or the exact opposite thing, we could say the minimum age. So there's going to be the lowest for both the male and the female. Go and run this. Now we have female and male and the minimum age is 29 and 34. There is one last one that I want to show you which is count. We're going to do count. Now count is going to count the actual rows within this age column. So if we run this, you'll see that we have four females for count and we have seven males. It's just telling us a count of how many values is in this column when we're actually grouping on the gender. So that's how we can use group by to actually roll up and group all of these similar values within a column or columns and perform our aggregate functions on them. Now let's come down here and what we're going to take a look at is order by. Let's say order by. Now let's actually pull in this demographics table right here. We're just going to say select everything and run this really quickly after we got a semicolon. So order by order by is going to actually sort the result set in either ascending or descending order. Let's take a look at how this works. At the very end, we could say order by and we could order by the first underscore name. So we're going to take this column and we're going to order all of our rows based off of this one column. Let's go ahead and run this. So it's going to do it based off ascending origin means smallest to largest. Now this is a text column or a character column. So we do it a to z. So Andy and April all the way down to Tom. Now by default, this is in a sc order ascending order. And if we run this, it's going to be the exact same output. But we can change this to do it the opposite highest to lowest or z to a by doing descending. So now if we run this, you'll see that goes Tom all the way down to Andy. Now let's take a look at ordering on something like gender and age because we can do both at the same time. So let's order by the gender first. Let's go ahead and run this. And you'll see that all the females are grouped together and then all the males are grouped together because that's just the order in which it is. But we can do an additional column. We could also do it based off of the age. Let's go ahead and run this. So now within the female, since that came first in our order by, we're ordering by the gender. And then we're also ordering by the age after we've ordered by the gender. So now it's 29 all the way up to 46. Then 34 for males all the way up to 61. Now we can change this just for the age. Let's say we want to do age descending. So gender will stay the same in ascending order. And now age will be in descending order. Go ahead and run this. Now female and male stay the same. But now it starts at the highest down to the lowest. Now this is something that I would absolutely do in real life except sometimes you can make mistakes and sometimes you do the wrong column first. Let's do age and then we'll do gender. Now if we run this, the gender is not going to be used at all. And this is because there are no unique values that are going to be on the same row. So notice all these values are completely unique. So the gender never is actually used to order anything on because if there were things like 34, 34, 34, 34, 34, these would be ordered based off of the gender. But since there's no unique fields, this is really pretty useless. That's why the order of the order by or the columns that you place in the order by are actually quite important.

Now the last thing that I want to show you and I'll just go back to gender and age is that you don't actually have to use the column names. We can use the column positions. Now I will preface this by saying I don't recommend doing this, but I sometimes do it in shorthand for just a quick query. If I know the column position and I don't want to write out the whole name, sometimes I do it, although it's not best practice. Let's take a look at it. So gender is the one, two, three, four, fifth column. I'm going to replace this with five and age is the one, two, three, four column. So these are the positions of the fields, but not the names of them. If we run it, we're going to get the exact same output because these represent these columns appropriately. But again, I just don't recommend it. It's kind of a slippery slope that I've fallen down myself many times. And when you get to more advanced SQL and you're creating things like stroke procedures and triggers and all these things, this can actually cause a lot of issues. If you were to add any columns or remove any columns, then you'd be ordering by the wrong column because let's say this last name got removed. We didn't want it for some reason. Then the gender is one, two, three, four. Now we're ordering on the wrong column. And that would be a big mistake. So just by best practice, it is better to do gender on the age, but I just wanted to show you that. In case, you want to be like me and kind of go down the wrong path. So that is everything we're going to take a look at with group by and order by in the next lesson. We're going to be taking a look at having versus where.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to take a look at the difference between having and where. Now in the last lesson, we looked at GroupBuy and OrderBuy. The most obvious thing to do would be to come right here and say where, and we're going to say this column, which is actually named this, we'll say where the average age, let's say is greater than 40, which would only be the males. So let's go ahead and run this. And as you can see, we're not getting any output. Let's bring this up and take a look at the error. It says invalid use of the GroupBuy function. What's actually happening is something to do with this GroupBuy gender right here. When we're selecting gender and then we're performing an aggregate function, this occurs only after the GroupBuy actually groups those rows together. So when we're trying to filter based off of this column right here of average age, it really hasn't been created yet because this GroupBuy hasn't happened. That's where the having clause comes into play. So let's go ahead and what we're going to do is we're going to get rid of this. We're going to come right down here and instead of where we're going to say having. Now, having was specifically created for this exact example. It comes right after GroupBuy and after GroupBuy, we can filter based off of these aggregate functions. So now if we run this, we're going to get an output that only has where the average age is greater than 40. Now let's take a look at just one more example and I'm going to show you how you can use both and one query. So instead of demographics, let's look at the salary table and let's run it. Now in this salary table, we have this occupation and remember we have this office manager that happens twice and this is going to be our main example. So we're going to say occupation and then we'll say the average salary. Now we'll need to come down here and we'll say GroupBuy. Now we're going to say occupation. So this should look pretty similar because right here we have our office manager and one of the office managers made 50, one of the office managers made 60 so the average is 55,000. Now I can use the where by saying where. Now I'll say occupation like and let's see people who are managers. So I'll say percent manager percent and close that quote. So they're like a manager and then I want to see where a manager makes more than let's say 75,000. So I won't actually say where I'm going to say having an average salary and then you add a space there. Having an average salary greater than let's say 75,000. And let's run this. So now I filtered at the row level right here in the where clause but then down here I filtered at the aggregate function level. This having is only going to work for aggregated functions after the GroupBuy actually runs. So that is the difference between the having clause and the where clause. The where clause you're most likely going to use a lot more. But if you do want to filter on this aggregated function columns, you have to use the having clause. I hope that that was really helpful. And in the next lesson, we're looking at our very last lesson in our beginner series. We're going to look at limit and alias ID.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at limit and aliasing. Limit is just going to specify how many rows you want in your output. If we take this table, for example, if we come right here and we say limit, let's do three. If we run this, it's only going to take the top three that we have. Let's go ahead and run this. As you can see, we have, play one, three, and four, Leslie, Tom, and April. Now, this seems super straightforward, really, really easy, but it can be combined with order by to actually be really powerful. For example, let's say we wanted to take the three oldest employees. All we'd have to do is come right under here and we say order by and we'll order by the age and descending order. So we're going to order on age descending and then it's going to take the top three. So if we run this, and very quickly, we have the top three oldest people in this table. Now, there is one additional parameter that we can use in limit and all we have to do to access it is have a comma here. Now, what this is going to do, and I'll put a one here. What this is going to do is it's now going to say we're going to start at position three and then we're going to go one row after it. Now, I actually want to take one of these people. So let's start at position two and select the next one after it, which should be Leslie Note. So we're going to start at position two and we're going to select the one right after it. So we're going to start at position two and then one means we're taking the next one row. Let's go ahead and run this. And as you can see, we've got Leslie Note in our output. Now, let's come right down here. We are going to now look at aliasing. Now, aliasing is just a way to change the name of the column for the most part. And it can also be used in joins, but we're going to take a look at joins or aliasing joins in the intermediate series. In a previous lesson, we looked at a group by that looked like this. We select the gender. Let me say from, I believe it was employee underscore demographics. Let me say group by gender. And we also had the average, and I think it was age. There we go. And we'll add our semi column. Go ahead and run this. In our output, we have gender as our gender column, the same as the column name, but then average age is average age. And so if we want to actually do something like a having, where we say having the average age, let's say greater than 40, like we had it, we have to actually use this aggregate function in our having clause. And we don't want to always have to do that. We can actually change the name of this column and subsequently use it throughout our query with that alias name. So I'm going to say as, and that's the key word to actually change it. We'll say as we'll do average underscore age. So now we've changed this name to average underscore age. And we can come down here to having, and say having the average age greater than 40. And when we run this, it works perfectly. And you'll notice that the name of the column is actually changed. Now this has isn't actually 100% needed. It's kind of implied, even if we get rid of it, it's implied there's like this has in there somewhere. But we don't have to have it. If we took it out and ran it like this, it would still work exactly the same. So that is how we can use limit and aliasing in SQL. And congratulations. This is the end of the beginner series in my SQL. In the intermediate series, we're going to take a look at things like joins, unions, case statements, sub queries, and window functions.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson we're going to be taking a look at joins. Joins allow you to combine two tables or more together if they have a common column. That doesn't mean the column name has to be the exact same, but at least the data within it are similar that you can use. There are several joins that we're going to look at today like inner joins, outer joins, and self joins. These are the two tables that we'll be working with the most throughout this lesson. We have the employee demographics table as well as the employee salary table. Now within the employee demographics table we do have this employee ID column. If we look at the employee salary, we also have the employee ID column. So in this instance the column name is actually the exact same, and of course the data inside of it is also very similar. So let's start by writing out an inner join. This is probably one of the most common joins, one of the most simple joins as well. The inner join is going to return rows that are the same in both columns from both tables. So let's see how we can actually write out this join. Let's get right down here. Let's copy this. This will be the first table that we start with, and then we'll join the salary table onto this demographics table. So what we need to do is we need to come right here and we need to say join. By default, join represents an inner join, although we can write inner join here to make it more explicit, explicitly writing out inner join. Then we're going to come up here and we're going to say employee salary. So we're selecting everything from the employee demographics, and we're doing an inner join on the employee salary. Now we have to tell my sequel exactly what columns were supposed to be joining on. I'm going to hit enter and I'm going to hit tab. Now you don't have to hit tab. It just looks more code like and it's easier to read and that's how I've done it for other programming languages as well. So that's how I'm going to show you how to do it. What we need to do is say on now this keyword is going to allow us to say we're joining the demographics table to the salary table based on these two columns. So from the demographics table, we're doing the employee underscore ID is equal to. And then in the salary table, it's also the employee ID. Let's do employee. Now you spell it right employee underscore ID. Now if we try to run this and let's do this, we're going to get an error and let's bring this up. It's going to say column employee ID on the in clause is ambiguous. Now what does it mean ambiguous? That means that it doesn't know what table this employee ID is from. Is it from the employee demographics table? Is it from the employee salary table? We don't know because it's ambiguous. Now what we can do is we can specify it by saying employee demographics dot employee ID and then employee salary dot employee ID. Now if we run this, we're going to get the output that we're looking for and let's take a look at this real quick. Let me bring this up. So we're pulling everything from the employee demographics right here all the way through the birth date. Then we're pulling the employee salary table. That's the employee ID all the way. Let's scroll over through the department ID. So we're basically pulling in all of the rows or all the columns from both tables. But we're not pulling in all of the rows. Remember, an inner join is only going to bring over the rows that have the same values in both columns that we're tying on. So in this employee ID, we're missing number two. We're missing any other ones. No, we're only missing number two. Let's go back up and I'm going to run both of these tables. I'm going to take a look. So let's run this. So you'll notice in the employee salary table, we have a number two right here. That's Ron Swanson. But in the employee demographics table, we don't have that. I believe that Ron Swanson did this so that Leslie Nope would not know when his birth date was because he didn't want to bring that information. I think that makes the most sense, although Ron was not willing to give a comment on that. Now, if we run this again, you'll notice that two is not in there. Since two is not in the employee demographics table, the employee ID two is not going to be populated or brought over into this output from the employee salary table. Now, really quickly, this is honestly giving me some anxiety because this is so incredibly long. Something that I mentioned in the beginner's series is that you can use something called aliasing when using joins. And that's really helpful. This is what I mean. So right here, we have employee demographics. We're going to call this DM. You can also do as DM. You can do as SAL. These are just short names for demograp",

So right here, we have employee demographics. We're going to call this DM. You can also do as DM. You can do as SAL. These are just short names for demographics and short name for salary. And we can replace these and say DM dot employee ID and SAL dot employee ID. Oh, that looks so much better. Now we're going to run this and it'll be the exact same output. But now we're using these aliases, which just makes it so much easier to read. Now, one last thing that I want to show you while we're just looking at the inner join is selecting the actual columns. Let's say we want to select the employee ID. And we wanted to select age and then we wanted to select their occupation. If we try to run this, we're going to get an error. It's going to be almost the exact same error that we got before, which is column employee ID in field list is ambiguous. So in our field list, which is right up here in the select statement, we have this employee ID. It does not know which employee ID to pull from, whether it's the demographics or the salary. So we have to tell it which one to pull from. So let's pull it from the demographics by saying dm dot employee ID. Now when we run this, we're able to get information from both tables in our output without having all of the information. And if there are columns that are similar in both tables, we have to denote that by using this alias or the table name. All right. So that is inner joins. Now let's move down here. I'm going to copy this and we're going to come right down here. And we're going to look at outer joins next. And let's put that right here now for outer joins. We have a left join and we have a right join or a left outer and a right outer join. A left join is going to take everything from the left table, even if there's no match in the join. And then it will only return the matches from the right table. The exact opposite is true for a right join. Let's see how this actually works. Let's start by changing this to a left join or a left outer join. They're both the same and you can use them similarly. I'm just going to say left join and we're joining it on the exact same things. And I'm going to take everything so I think that'll be easier to visualize. And I'm going to run this. Now you may notice that this looks exactly the same. And that's for a very good reason. It's because in the left table, which is the employee demographics table, the from statement, that's our left table. And then the join where we're actually joining on, that's our right table. So this is our right table. So since we're doing a left, it's taking everything from the employee demographics. Now remember, the employee demographics didn't have Ron Swanson. It had no information. So everything in the right table had a match. Let's change this to a right join. And what this is going to do, and I want to make it all count, make it all the same. What this is going to do is it's going to take everything from the employee salary table. But if there is not a match in the employee demographics, it just will have noles. Let's go ahead and run this. So now it looks a little bit different. Now we're taking everything from the employee salary. So we're taking Ron Swanson. But if there is not a match, it will still populate that row, but it'll off all noles in it. Then any of the information that is overlapping or the same, it will bring over. So employee ID is match to employee ID one. Then we'll bring all that information over from the left table. And that's essentially what a left and a right join is. With a left table, you're taking everything from the left table, and then matches from the right table. If you do a right join, you're taking everything from the right table, but only matches on the left table. And again, it populates it with noles. Now let's go down and look at our last type of join that we're going to look at. And this is a self. Let me spell that right. A self join. Now what is a self join? It",

Now let's go down and look at our last type of join that we're going to look at. And this is a self. Let me spell that right. A self join. Now what is a self join? It is a join where you tie the table to itself. Now why would you want to do this? Let's take a look at a very serious use case. Let's do select everything. Let's do this from employee underscore salary. And let's run this. Now let's say it's December 1st, and the employee and Rex department decided to do a secret service. And they wanted to assign based off of their employee ID, the person who they're going to have as a secret Santa. We can help orchestrate this very easily using my sequel. Well, very easily subjective, I guess, but let's take a look at how we can do this. So just like any other join, the first thing we're going to do is select everything from employee salary and then say join. And then we're going to say employee salary again. So we're tying it to itself. Now when we come down here, and let me do this, when we come down here and we say on, we have to specify which table we're pulling from. Are we pulling from the left table, which is like the first table we're pulling from or we pulling from when we're joining on the right table. We need to be able to distinguish these two tables because they are the same. So I'm going to say, MP1, and I'm going to say MP2. Just to say this employee table one and employee table two. So we're going to tie them based off the employee ID because we know those will be the exact same because we're pulling from the same table. So we'll do MP1 dot employee. And just so you know if it populates like this, you can hit tab and it'll auto finish that for you. And MP2 dot employee underscore ID. Now if we run this, let's do this. The output that we're going to get is literally just a one for one match. It's all the columns and all the rows because they all match exactly. But now what we're going to do is we're going to sign an employee ID to the next employee ID and that will be their secret Santa. So just keep it really simple. The next highest person with an employee ID, that is their secret Santa. So let's do an employee ID plus one is equal to employee to dot employee ID. So we're adding one over here and we're saying that's equal to this employee ID over here. Let's run this. So now you can see Leslie. Nope is now going to be assigned to Ron Swanson who has an idea of two. Ron Swanson is going to be assigned to Tom Haviford, which I'm sure he's really happy about and so on and so forth. Now let's bring this down here. And what we're going to do is try to simplify this and simplify this output a little bit because this is a little bit chaotic down here. So we want to specify what columns we want in our output. What we're going to want is the employee ID, first name last name, and then employee ID, first name last name of the person who they got for secret Santa. So we're going to start with MP1 dot employee employee underscore ID and we can call this. We'll just say as MP underscore Santa and we'll do a comma and we'll come down. Now I need to spell employee right. So we have our employee ID and now we need our first name and last name. Now remember Leslie. No, it's going to be the secret Santa for Ron Swanson. I don't know if I made that clear, but that's I guess how it works. So now we need to do MP1 dot and we'll do first underscore name and we'll do as we do as first underscore name underscore Santa. We can do a comma. We'll do the exact same thing except for the last name. So last underscore name as last underscore name Santa. Now all we have to do is do a copy all this, bring it down here and change this to two. They're pulling from the second table. And it looked just like this and get rid of this comma and this is done. Let's run it and let's bring this up. So we have employee Santa first name Santa Leslie last name Santa. Nope, then employee Santa and we actually need to change these names. That",

We'll just change it to employee name first name employee and last name employee. And now when we run this, we have our Santa and then we just have the employee who this person is going to be the Santa for now. This is kind of a silly way to look at it. But in essence, this is exactly how a self join works. Now the very, very, very last thing I promise you. The last thing that I want to show you is how we can join multiple tables together. So I'm going to say joining multiple names, baller, right? Multiple tables together. Now not just one table together to another table. I'm talking about one table to another table to another table. So let's go all the way back up. We're going to take this right here and bring it all the way down. And what we're now going to do is we're going to tie in this table right here, the parks department. Let's actually look at this table and let's select everything real quick. And let's run this. Now let's go down here and we're going to say select everything. We'll do this from park underscore departments. And let's run this. Now this is something called a reference table. This is not a table that most likely you'll ever add a bunch of information to. It's there to reference that we have these department names. Tables like the salary table or employee demographics table are going to change pretty often. As people get raises or as they get older with their age, those are going to be updated fairly often. Whereas this parks department table is just there for reference. If we look down here in the columns, we have a department ID. Then we have a department name. So we have the ID and the name of that ID. If we run our join and we scroll all the way to the right, you'll notice we have a DEPT ID. This stands for department ID. That's in the salary table. So what we want to do is join this department ID to the department ID from the parks and rec. So what we can do is we're going to say enter join. And now we're going to join. Let's scroll down just a hair. There we go. Now we're going to take this and do it off this. So we're going to call this PD for short. And we're going to say we're joining it on now. We cannot join this parks department to the employee demographics table. Why is that? Well, the employee demographics table only has employee ID all the way through birth date. There's no common column that we can tie to this parks department. The only table that has a common column is this department ID in the salary table. So what we need to do is actually take sal. So we'll say s-a-l dot. Then we're going to say DEP. And we'll say department ID is equal to the PD dot. And we need to take the department ID. Now notice these are not the exact same name. They are a little bit different, but they have the same values. One thing I forgot to mention is that in this parks department, there's no repeating. That's why it's a reference. Whereas in the salary, the department ID repeats several times because multiple people are in the same department. So this reference table also usually does not have duplicates. Just one other thing to note. But we have now tied it successfully. Let's try to run this. And if we come down here, go all the way to the right. We now have the department ID, 1111111, and the department ID and department name, parks and recreation, healthcare, public works, finance, public works, and parks and recreation. So this worked perfectly. So this is how you can tie multiple tables together if you have common columns between them. Even though employee demographics has no column that's related to the parks department table, we can still tie them together based through this employee salary. Because employee demographics can tie to employee salary, employee salary can tie to the parks depar",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at unions in my SQL. A union allows you to combine rows together, not like columns like we were doing before with joins, where one column is next to the other, and union allows you to combine the rows of data from separate tables or from the same table. It's up to you, but you do that by taking one select statement and using a union to combine it with another select statement. Let's see how this actually looks. What we're going to do is right after the select statement, we're going to come here and say union, then we're going to go right below the union and we're going to do another select statement. So we're going to copy this, place it right here, but instead of the demographics table, just for example, we'll do the salary table. Now if we look at the demographics table, let's say we want to take age and gender, and let's go and take a look really quickly at the salary table. And let's say we want to take a first name and last name. We'll do first underscore name and last underscore name. Now let's go ahead and run this and see what it looks like. And let's pull this up. So as you can see, we have age and gender, that's from the very first select statement and that's also the column names. But then we have all of the data for the age and gender. And then below, if we move this over a little bit, we have the last name and first name from the employee salary table. It's just down here. Now what I just demonstrated is that this doesn't always work for everything. You can't just combine random data together because this is bad data. We shouldn't have age and gender mixed with first name and last name. Really when you're using this, you need to keep the data the same. So for us, we should take the first, and I'll actually just copy this, the first and last name from the employee demographics as well. And let's run this. And now we have all the names from all of the tables. Now you may be thinking where did all the other day to go before we had a lot of rows, but now we only have a unique row for each one. Well by default, this is actually a union distinct. And if you remember, distinct is only going to take unique values. So when we're doing this, union is going to remove all the duplicates. And the first name and last name from salary overlaps a lot with the employee demographics table. So when we ran this, the only one that's actually somewhat unique to one table is that in the employee salary table, we have Ron Swanson, whereas we don't have that in the employee demographics. Now if we wanted to show all of them without the distinct, there is something called a union all. If we run this, now we're going to get all of the results without removing any of the duplicates. So if we were scroll down, we're going to have duplicates in here, but we're just showing all of the results from this table and from this table. Now that we know how to actually use a union, let's look at a use case. So let's go right down here and let's copy this. Why not? And let's put it right down here. Now let's say in the employee demographics, we wanted to take the first name and last name where the age is greater than 50. And let's run this. There's only one person, but let's label them. Let's have a label. We're going to say comma old. So this person is old. And if we run this, it says first name, last name and old. And we can even call this as label. And if we run this, the label is old. So Jerry Gurgich is the only old person in this demographics table. Now why are we doing this? Well, the parks department is trying to cut their budget a little bit. They want to identify older employees that they can push out. And they also want to identify high paid employees who they can reduce their pay or push them out to save money. So we just identified someone who's older, who we're going to want to try to push out. But let's in the same output, find people who are also highly paid. So now we can come down here. We can say union. And let's do this like this. I need to spell this right. It's our union. And let's take this. We're not going to be using this exact same query, but we actually need to pull from the salary table for the employee salary. So we also want the first name and last name. Let's say where their salary is greater than let's say 70,000. Because that's a lot of money. If you're making more than 70, for sure, the park's apartment is going to try to get rid of you. But for the label, we're going to change it to a highly paid employee. Now",

But for the label, we're going to change it to a highly paid employee. Now let's go ahead and run this. So now we have Leslie Nope and Chris Trigger. They're both labeled as highly paid employees. Now 50 I think is just a little too low. If I'm being completely honest, I think we had changed this and we should do a union and then add another select statement. Let's bring this down. I think the 50 is too low. Let's change it to 40. And let's add one more thing. Let's say and the gender is equal to male. And then we'll go down here and say where the gender is equal to female. Because we want to separate this out. So we want to know who's the old man. Well, that's actually old lady. This is the female one. And for up here where it's male, we'll say old man. So we have three different select statements using two separate unions. We're selecting the first name and the last name and all of them keeping the data consistent. And then in our third column, we're labeling it either old man, old lady or highly paid employee. Go ahead and run this. And let's look at our output. Now you may notice something really quickly that Chris Trigger and Leslie Note are an old man and an old lady and Leslie Note and Chris Trigger are both highly paid employees. So these people meet multiple criteria. So let's actually order by and then we'll do first underscore name, comma last underscore name because we want to order by these to see. So let's run. And now we can easily see that Chris Trigger is both of these Donna's just an old lady. There is just an old man and Leslie is both an old lady and a highly paid employee. So now we can send this to whoever we need to send it to to make sure that these people get looked at first so that our job is still secure. The job market is tough these days. You got to do what you got to do. So that is how we use union. Let's just take one more look at it. Here we go. So this is how we can use unions. It's kind of a real use case. I've done something very similar to this in my real job. But you know, this is just an example of how you can have multiple select statements all combined or combining the rows using a union. In the next lesson, we're going to be taking a look at case statements.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at string functions. Now, string functions are built in functions within my SQL that will help us use strings and work with strings differently. Now, we're going to look at a ton of different ones. They all have different use cases, but I'll try to walk through some of those as we go along, but we'll look at a lot of different string functions in this lesson. We'll start off with one that's really simple. This one is called length. If we select, then we say length, and let's say we put in, and I don't know why it's popping up like that, let's say we put in something like sky or skyfall or really anything. If we run this, it's going to give us the length of how long this string is. So if I come down here, we say select everything from employee underscore demographics. Let's add a semicolon here and let's run this one right down. Now, what we can do is we can look at how long each person's name is. What we can do is just take the first name, but then we'll also do the length of the first underscore name. So if you run this, now we get Leslie Tom Jerry, Donna, and it gives us the length of their name. If we wanted to, we could even order by this. So we could do order by and we could just do two for now. And we can order by the length from the shortest name all the way to the longest name. Now, one use case that I've used length for in my actual job was when I was working with phone numbers, I wanted to make sure that they were exactly 10 characters long. Otherwise, something went wrong somewhere in the data cleaning process. So I would go and look at the length and I would make sure they're all 10. If anywhere above 10, I would go and specifically look at those and try to clean those and fix those up. Now let's go on to the next one. And these next ones are pretty simple ones, at least I think they're fairly simple. We're going to look at upper first and doing the same thing as the other one. We'll do upper and let's say we're going to do sky. If we select upper sky, it's going to give us an all upper case or we can copy this and we can do lower. So now let me add some of my columns. Otherwise, it's going to drive me crazy. Let's try this lower now. It's going to do all lower, even if I make it all capital. So if I say all capital sky, it's going to make it all lower. So if we come back up, let's copy this and instead of doing the length, now we'll do upper. Let's go ahead and select this. So we have Leslie and then we have the upper first name. So upper all case Leslie. Now, this is actually really good. This is really helpful, especially with standardization is what I found a great use case for it because sometimes it'll be all capital Tom and sometimes I'll put it in as T lower case O M and just making them all upper case or all lower case can help correct those really simple standardization issues within a single column. The next one that we're going to look at is trim. Now, there's multiple trims. We have trim, left trim and right trim. Trim is basically going to take the white space on the front or the end and get rid of it, which is really, really helpful. So what we're going to do is we're going to come right here, say, select and we'll start off with trim. Let me add a semicolon every time. So then we'll do trim and for our actual string, we'll do something a little bit odd. We'll do some spaces and then we'll do a sky and then we'll add some spaces. Now let's run this and add our semicolon. That's going to be the end of me in this lesson. Just adding semicolons. Now, it fixes it completely. Now, what if we don't add sky at all? We'll just keep it like this. Well, you can see there's spaces before and there's spaces after, but that's what trim does. Trim gets rid of the leading and the trailing white spaces. Now, if we come up here and we just do the left trim, it's only going to remove from the left hand side. So we're only getting rid of the left hand side white spaces. This right hand side, as you can see, is really long. It's still there. And if we do our trim, we go ahead and run this one. It gets rid of the white space on this side, but it doesn't get rid of the left space on this side. Now, let's keep going. We have a lot to cover still. We're going to move on to what I think is probably my most favorite string function. If I'm allowed to have a favorite string function and that's substring, but I'm going to kind of work us into substring a little bit by looking at two smaller functions, which is left and right. So let's select everything and we'll do that from the employee demographics again, that are semicolon. Now, I'm going to run this. Now, I want to get the first name and I'm going to do left of the first underscore name, just like this. Now",

So let's select everything and we'll do that from the employee demographics again, that are semicolon. Now, I'm going to run this. Now, I want to get the first name and I'm going to do left of the first underscore name, just like this. Now, when you're using this is actually going to be an error. Let's see if I highlight over this. It will tell me what the error is. It says the parentheses is not a valid position. They're expecting something else. And basically what they're telling us is that this is not how it should be written. We're looking for a different value. That different values actually a number. We're going to do comma and let's do four. That's what it was looking for. It didn't want this at the end. It needed this comma for. And what we're actually specifying is how many characters from the left hand side do we want to select? So we're selecting the first name and we're going from the left for characters. Go ahead and run this. And so we have Leslie, Tom, April, all the way down. You can see that there's only four characters in each one. So someone like Chris, the ass is no longer going to be there because we're only looking at the first four characters. Now we can do the exact same thing. And let's actually copy this down here. So we'll come, we'll go like this, I make this a little more professional and we'll do right. So now we'll do right. If we do the right for it's going to go from the right hand side of the string and go left for. So we're looking at the far for most right characters. Now this can be useful in certain instances, but if I'm being honest, I don't use these that much. Or the most part, I'm pretty addicted to using substrings. I love substrings. I think they're fantastic. And let's look at substrings like this. So a substring is going to allow us to do a few different things. Let's do first underscore name. The second thing that we put within this function is the position that we want to start at. So let's say we want to start at the third position and then we specify how many characters we want to go. So with this we specify four blushes do two. So now we're going to the third position and we're going over to the right two characters. Let's go ahead and run this. So with Leslie, we get SL. So we go one, two and three. We started the third position and then we take two characters, the S and the L. I have found this one to be extremely, extremely useful. Let's take this, for example, let's do comma, let's do birth underscore date. And let's run this. I'm giving everything in here, although it might be a bit much. Well, let's say we have this birthday and this middle column is the month. And we're running some query. We want to find the month that everyone is born. So we can do that very easily using substring and we wouldn't have been able to do this very easily using left or right. So now we're going to take this birth date and we use this substring and want to select these middle characters. So what we need to do since it's all standardized, we do one, two, three, four, five, six, we start position six. And we want to select one and two. Let's go ahead and run this. And now we've pulled out all of the months so we can say as birth underscore month. And now we could save that put into a tent table, add it as a new column in our table, whatever we want to do. But now we have this information that we desperately, desperately wanted to know. So that is left, right and substring again, substring is it's fantastic. Now let's keep going. The next thing that we're going to take a look at is replace. Now replace will replace specific characters with a different character that you want. So let's actually copy all this right here because I don't want to keep writing this out. And we'll say select everything. Now what we're going to do is we're going to take the first underscore name and then we're going to say replace. And then we'll also do the first underscore name, but we can specify what we want to replace and then what we want to replace it with. So we have two more parameters that we nee",

And then we'll also do the first underscore name, but we can specify what we want to replace and then what we want to replace it with. So we have two more parameters that we need to put in this function. So let's say a and let's replace it with a Z. Let's just see what that does. Let's go ahead and run this. And so now when we see the letter a and we are specifying a lower case a like mark that is replaced with a Z. So that's really all replace does specifies what you want to replace and then what you're going to replace it with. Now let's take a look at the next one and we're going to take a look at a function called locate. So if I say select and let's do locate, I'm going to give it a string. I'll say Alexander. That's my name. And I'm going to specify what I'm looking for. So let's close this parentheses. The string that we're actually looking for comes first. So what we're going to do is I'm looking for the letter X in my name. So do X in Alexander. Go ahead and run this. And it tells us that it is in position for. So we have one, two, three and four. That's where our position is. That's where it locates that sequence that we're looking for. Now if we pull this down here, place this right here and we'll change this locate. Now let's say we're still looking at the first name, but we want to locate people that have an a N like this in their name. Let's go ahead and run this. And we get zeros for everybody except for an and Andy. So this might be something where we put it into a CTE or a temp table. Then we can filter down based off of these results towards only equals one. Now the last one that we're going to take a look at and let's go right here. We're going to first name last underscore name. Now this one is super super useful because what we can do is have a concatenation of multiple columns. So let's go down right here. So we have first name and last name, but if we come down and we say concaten, we can then combine these columns into one single column. So we'll do concaten and do first underscore name and then comma last underscore name. And if we run this, it's going to be Leslie and nope combined into Leslie. Now this doesn't look perfect. Right. We don't want it to look like that. All we have to do is come in here and we could do a little space. So a lot of space in there. And if we run that, now we have Leslie and nope. And we can call this as full underscore name. And this is something that I've done a million times in my real job where there's multiple columns. We want to create one column out of it or take two columns and create one column happens all the time. So this concaten is really, really helpful to combine those columns really quickly. So that is all we're going to take a look at in this string functions lesson in my full course. You can find in the description below. I also have lessons on numeric functions, date and time functions, converting different data types all in the functions module.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at case statements in my SQL. A case statement allows you to add logic in your select statement, sort of like an if else statement and almost all other programming languages or even things like Excel. Let's see how this actually works. So let's bring this down and let's take this employee demographics table and let's take the first name and let's take the last name and let's add a case statement. How we need to do this is we have to say case. So that's going to signify that we're starting a case statement and then I'm going to go over here and say tab. So this is where our logic comes into play. So I'm going to say when the age, let's say is less than or equal to 30. Then so I'm saying if the age is less than or equal to 30, then what's going to happen? We'll just keep it really simple for now. We'll just say that this person is young. And then if we want to end the case statement, we'll come down here and say end. So this is a complete case statement. Let's go ahead and run it. And let's take a look at the output. So we have the first name, we have the last name and then we have this case statement right here. And if their age is less than or equal to 30, they're young. Let's actually add the age right here just so we can visually see that as well. So we have the age. So this person is the only person who's under or equal to the age of 30 that's April. So she has a label of young. The great thing about case statements is you can add multiple wind statements. So we can come down here and say when and then we can do something like when age and maybe we'll say between. So I don't know if in previous lessons we looked at between, but between just says between this number and this number. So we'll say between 31 and 50 if they're between 31 and 50. Well, good night. That person is old. So we're going to have it just like this. We're going to run it. And now we have a lot of people who are old. These are all people between the ages of 31 and 50, but we solve more people outside of the age of 50 or older than 50. So we could do when the age and now we can say greater than or equal to 50 and we're going to say then and then we're going to say on. Deaths door because good night if you're over 50. My parents are going to love me for this one. So let's go ahead and run this. And then if we look at this, we have on death star right there. Now this is huge. This is massive. So let's actually name this and we'll just say as at the end of end. So right after end, we'll say as age bracket. And let's run this. And this looks a lot better. So now we have this age bracket just signifying kind of where people are at and most people are quite old or Jerry. You know, can't catch or break that guy. Now let's go down and let's take a look at a different table. So let's select everything will be from employee underscore salary. Now that we have our employee salary table, here is the scenario that we are given the Pawnee Council sent out a memo of their bonus and pay increase for end of year. And we need to follow it and determine people's end of your salary or the salary going into the new year. And if they got a bonus, how much was it? So the first thing we need to do is we need to get the pay increase and bonus. And their pay increases look like this. So if they made less than 50,000, then that equals a 5% raise very generous. And if they made greater than 50,000 that equals a 7% raise very, very generous. Lastly, if they work in the finance department, that equals a 10% bonus, just cash that goes into their bank account, very, very generous, but only the finance department gets it. So these are the guidelines that the Pawnee Council sent out and it is our job to determine and figure out those pay increases as well as the bonuses. So let's come right down here. We're going to have our salary employee. I actually want to be able to see these. Let me pull this up just to touch. There we go. So we want to be able to write this out. So first thing we should do is just select the columns that we need. First name, last name, probably salary as well. And now what we c",

And now what we can do is determine this first one, which is if they make less than 50,000, they get a 5% raise. So let's say case and also add end in here. And we're going to say when their salary is less than 50,000, what's going to happen? Then we say then salary. So we're taking their initial salary and we're saying plus. Then we're going to do salary times 0.05. And if we run this should work, pull this up really quickly. So April, lead gate, she made under 50,000. So she got a raise and her new salary is 26,250. We can actually call that. We'll say as a underscore, actually, let's do new underscore salary. That's our new salary. And let's run this. So the new salary is 26,250. Andy Dwyer is now making 21,000. Now this calculation, you can do it different ways. We can do it exactly like this. Or you just do times 1.05 should be the exact same thing. Just however you would like to write it out. It's just, you know, adding it or multiplying it by this. So let's take this. And now we're going to say when it is greater than 50,000. So let's say greater than 50,000, they get a 1.07. So this is the 7% increase. This is a 5% increase. This is a 7% increase. And let's run this. And let's put this up here. So now if they made greater, so 50,000, 75,000, they got a 7% increase. Now, unfortunately, we did not make the rules. The Plenty Council did and the people who made exactly 50,000, unfortunately, were not part of those brackets. And that just wasn't up to us. We couldn't control that. So unfortunately, Tom Havafford and Jerry Gurgich just didn't get raises this year. And that's not our fault. Okay. That's not our fault. Now the next thing that we need to do is determine the bonuses. Now let's come right back up here. Really quickly. Let's just copy this because what we need to determine is how we know that somebody is in the finance department. Because if they're in the finance department, that means they get a 10% bonus. That's really important. Now it's not in the employee demographics. Don't have anything about the department. But if we look in the salary and we run this, we do have the department ID. Now let's open up. And let's pull this up right here. We'll look at the parks department. And in the parks department, here we go. The finance is department ID of six. But if we're looking at the salary, there's only one person who's in department ID equal to six. So what we can do is another case statement. We can say comma, we'll do case and end. And we'll do another one. We're going to say when DEP to ID, so to win the department ID is equal to six, then we're going to give them a bonus. We're going to say salary times point 10. And we'll call this as bonus. Go ahead and run this. And let's pull it up. So he gets a $7,000 bonus this year that's been why it's because he was part of the finance department that just did an exceptional job this year, apparently according to the Plenty Council. So that is how case statements work. They're really powerful, really useful. I honestly use them quite often. And they're just a way to really add some logic and some labeling or even do calculations like we did right here with the salary. In the next lesson, we're going to be taking a look at some queries to my single.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at subqueries in my SQL. As subquery is basically just a query within another query. We can do this in a few different ways, and I'm going to try to show you a lot of the different variations within this lesson. The first way that we're going to use a subquery is in the Wear clause. Then we'll take a look at the Select and the From clause also. Let's take this demographics table that we have down here. What if we only wanted to select the employees who worked in the actual Parks and Rec department? Well, we could do that if we had a few joins. We have this salary table. And one actually represents that they work for the Parks and Rec. If we come over here and we open this up, we can see that Parks and Rec is the department idea of one. So we do have that option. We could just join these two tables together, but sometimes we don't want to do that and we'll use a subquery. Let's see how it works in the Wear clause. So let's go ahead and get rid of this. So what we're going to do is we're going to select everything from employee demographics Wear. And now we want to pull because this is the salary table. We want to pull employee IDs where the department ID is equal to one. Remember, we're querying off of this table. So let's actually pull this up. This is what we're working with. So we want to say, Wear the employee underscore ID. That's referencing this column in the demographics table. Is in what we're going to do is we're going to do a parentheses here. And we can even come down and put a parentheses down here. So what we're going to do now is write our query, which is our subquery. And this is our outer query. So now we're going to write an entirely other query within this. We'll say select. And now we're going to say employee underscore ID. And let's just bring this over. I usually have it something like this. And I'm going to try to bring this down a little bit. So select everything. And then we'll do from. And then instead of employee demographics, we'll do employee salary. And let's just format this a little better. So select the employee ID from employee salary. And remember, we wanted to do Wear the department ID is equal to one. Now let's bring this back up. And this is what the query is going to look like now. Just by itself, let's run this subquery or this inner query. When we run this, it's going to create this list of just employee IDs where the department ID is equal to one. So when we say Wear the employee ID from the employee demographics table is in, it's going to try to match those employee IDs to this list of employee IDs. So just remember one, two, three, four, five, six, and 12. Let's go ahead and run this entire query. Now we have one, three, four, five, six, 12. If you remember from previous lessons, the two is Ron Swanson. And he's only in the salary table. So since we're doing just the employee demographics table, he's not in here. So what we're doing is we're selecting everything from the employee demographics, where the employee ID in this table matches or is in the select employee ID from the salary table, where the department ID is equal to one. In essence, this is what a subquery is. It's a query within a query. Now what would happen if we have the employee ID, but we also wanted to say the department ID, because we just wanted to view this. Let's go ahead and try to run this. We are going to get no output. And we're going to get an error that says op-rand should contain one column. The op-rand referring to this entire thing right here, because this is an operator. So this is our op-rand. And we're returning two columns in here, which is saying we cannot do. We have to only have one. So now if we run this, it works perfectly well. Let's bring that down. Now we can also use the subquery in a select statement. So let's take a look at that next. Let's go down here. And let's say we want to do select everything from employee underscore salary. And let me spell that right. Let's say we want to look at all the salaries just like how we have it now. But in a column next to it, we also want to compare it to the average salary for everyone. So we'll be able to see whether somebody's salary is above average or below average. So what we would try to do potentially is do something like first underscore name, salary, and average salary. And we try to run this. And of course, we're going to get an error. It's going to basically tell us that we need to group by if we're doing th",

And we try to run this. And of course, we're going to get an error. It's going to basically tell us that we need to group by if we're doing this. So let's go back down. And let's actually add that group by. And we'll say group by first name and salary. And we'll look at this output. And this is not looking good at all. It's just looking at the average salary for each unique row, which is Leslie 75,000. So the average is 75,000. This is not what we're looking for. This is not what we want. Here's what we really do want. We want to just take the average salary of this entire column, regardless of group by or anything else. So let's get rid of this and let's see how we can do that. So let's come right down here. We're going to say select, select the average salary. And then we're going to say from our parentheses, because this is our sub query from the employee salary table, just like that. Now if we run this, we should get the exact output we're looking for. So the average salary is 57,250. And we have our salary right here. So we can compare really quickly just like that. And we can also use a sub query in the from statement. So let's go down here. And let's say select everything from employee underscore demographics. Have it autocomplete for me. So we have the employee demographics table. Now let's create a group by based off the gender column and add some aggregated functions. And I'm going to show you how you can use this as a sub query. Let's go up here. Say gender. And then we'll go ahead and add our group by. So say group by gender as well. Now let's add a few things. We'll do average. We'll do average age. And then we can do let's just do all of them based off the age. We'll just do age. Men of age and count of age. Oh, I try to write fast. It doesn't always go right. So we have this. Let's run this. And this is what our output is going to look like. Now what if we wanted to get the average of the oldest age or the average of the smallest ages or you know, see what the average count is for males and females. Well, we can't do that given this table. But let's do something right here. Select everything. And then we're going to say from an in our from statement, we're going to have a parentheses. We're going to paste our select statement and then close the parentheses. So we're going to select everything from this output that is right down here. So if we run just this, we're going to get an error in. Forgot this is going to happen. But every drive table must have its own alias. So you have to name a table. I forgot it does that. All we have to do to fix this is just name it. So we'll say as and we'll say aggregated table. We'll just call it aggregated table. So let's run this and we get the exact same output. But here's the neat thing is we can now select. We can do gender. And these are actually the column names now. So I can do the average of this column right here. But I can't do it just like this because it's going to give us an error. And I'll show you why in just a second says unknown column age in field list. So what it's saying is is we're trying to perform an aggregated function on the aggregation of an age column. But we don't have an age column in our table right here. Let me run this again. We have a column named this exact thing. So we actually need to do is do this backtick and backtick. This is the actual name of the column. It's not an aggregation anymore. The backtick on my laptop is right above the tab on the far left hand side right under the escape. That's where mine is. So these backticks, it's not a quote like this. It's a backtick. So you just need to find that on your keyboard. But now if we run this, it looks like we encountered another error says in aggregated query without grou",

But now if we run this, it looks like we encountered another error says in aggregated query without group by that's right. Now we need a group by. So now we need a group by gender. Sometimes you got to figure this out on the fly. And it should work. There we go. So now we can perform aggregations on this table. Now this doesn't actually work perfect because we're still grouping by the female male. But let's get rid of this for a second. And we'll get rid of this group by entirely. And if we run this, we're now looking at the averages of this column right here, max age. Now when you're doing something like this, it's actually really smart to rename these. We'll say as average underscore age. We'll say as max underscore age. And it makes it so much easier. You don't have to do these back ticks anymore. And as men underscore age and so on and so forth. And I would probably format this better and stuff like that. We don't have to go through everything right. I'm just going to give you an example. But then when we're using this table, these columns are actually named this. So I don't have to do these back ticks anymore. I can just take this whole thing. Oops, you're not sure where that back tick. Now I can just take this column because this is the column name. So let's go ahead and run this. And it's still going to work perfectly. So this one's pretty cool because you're basically creating this kind of like a temp table. You're just creating your own little output. Then you can query off of it and you could do more advanced calculations this way. It's actually really useful. But there are better ways to do something like this, like a CTE or a temp table that will look at in the advanced series. But this is at least how you can do it and you can actually try it out using sub queries. So that is all we're going to look at today for sub queries in the next lesson.

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at window functions. Now window functions are really powerful and are somewhat like a group by, except they don't roll everything up into one row when grouping. Window functions allow us to look at a partition or a group, but they each keep their own unique rows in the output. We're also going to look at things like row numbers, rank, and dense rank at the end of this lesson. So before we jump into writing a window function and seeing how the syntax works, let's actually write out a group by and then we'll compare the two when we actually do write the window function. Let's say we want to take this demographics table and we want to take this gender and compare it to the actual salaries. So what we actually need to do, we need to say join and we're going to join on the employee salary. Let's go like this, get rid of all of this and we'll do salary and we're going to say on and let's do DM and SAL for the early uses. We'll see DM dot employee underscore ID, so equal to SAL dot employee underscore ID. Now we're going to come up here and we're going to say gender, comma, and we want to look at the average salary and we need to get rid of this right here and we need to come down to the bottom and say group by gender. Now let's go ahead and run this query, see if it works and it did. So we have our gender and we have our average salary from our salary table and we can rename this as average or do average underscore salary just like that. So this is how group by works, it rolls everything up into one row. Now let's try doing something pretty similar except we're going to use a window function. Let's come right down here and let's paste this and let's start writing out our window function. Now we don't have to use the group by we're going to go ahead and get rid of that and right here for gender, we can keep that the exact same. All we're really going to change is this part right here. We're going to say average salary and that is parts of creating a window function. Typically with a straightforward window function, all we have to put is over with a closed parentheses. This is going to say we're looking at the average salary over and normally in here, you'll specify something and we'll get that in a little bit. Well, we're just going to look at an average salary over everything. So let's go ahead and run this output. So this is going to look a little bit different, right? So if the male and female all have their own individual rows, which is not the same as group by and this average salary is looking at the average salary of everybody. We're not breaking it out by the gender like we did up here. Here we rolled it up. Now we're looking at the average salary for the entire column. Now what we can do is actually partition by now partition by is going to separate it out kind of like grouping it. So let's say partition partition by we'll say gender. So just like when we did the group by the group by rolled everything up into one row, this is not going to roll everything up, but it is going to perform this calculation based off of the different genders, the unique values in this column. Let's go ahead and run this. And if you'll notice the female is 53,750, the male 57,428. Now let's go compare these. I'm going to run this and this query. Let's run this. So if we look at our group by, it's the exact same numbers except we have it on their own individual rows. Now why would we want this? Well, let's say we want additional information. So let's just look at this one for now. So in this one, let's say we wanted to add additional things like the first name. So we'll do dm dot first underscore name. We can do last or dm dot last underscore name. So we can add other information and it doesn't affect this column at all because we're using a window function. If we try to add these exact things, and I'm going to go up here and do it, if we try to add these exact things to this, let's see if the other works. And then we also have to group by this. If we run this query now, it's going to be completely different because we're using a group by we're grouping by the first name, the last name and the gender. We're breaking everything out based off of the unique values in these columns. Whereas down here, it's completely independent of what's going on in these other columns. All we're doing is we're doing a window function just based off of that column. So I think that's pretty amazing. And there's a lot of additional functionality that we can do with these window functions. And we're going to take a look at a lot of those things in just a little bit.

And there's a lot of additional functionality that we can do with these window functions. And we're going to take a look at a lot of those things in just a little bit. Let's try another example really quickly. Let's literally just copy this, based it down here. And all we're going to do is we're going to change this to some. So now instead of the average salary, we're looking at the sum of salaries and we're still partitioning by the gender. Let's go ahead and run this. Let's pull this up. So all the men together make $402,000. All the females make $215,000. Now what we're about to do is something called a rolling total. If you've never heard of a rolling total, a rolling total is super cool and can be done within my SQL. A rolling total is going to start at a specific value and add on values from subsequent rows based off of your partition. So all we have to do is add an order by and we're going to order by let's say the employee underscore ID. Let's go ahead and take a look at this. And it looks like the employee ID is ambiguous. I had a feeling. So I just need to say dm dot employee ID. Let's try this one. So now we have something called a rolling total. I'm going to actually name it as rolling underscore total because this is super cool. That window functions can do this. And this is something that a lot of people in like finance do. I did it myself when I worked in healthcare and it partitions based off of female and you can't see the employee ID, but there's an employee ID that we're kind of ordering on in the background. Now what it's doing is it's starting with Leslie. Nope. And she made $75,000. Then the next person April, she made $25,000 equals $100. And just to actually see this better, I'm going to add salary. And so Leslie, nope, had $75,000. Then we're adding this $25,000 to the $75. And we get $100. Then we're adding the $60,000 to $160,000. Then we're adding $55,000 to $215,000. So we're adding every single time. We're adding this salary to the already existing total all the way up to our grand total, which was $215,000. The exact same thing happens with the males. So we start with $50,000. Then we add $50. Then we add $90. Then we add $70. All we have to $402,000. Now you can do this in a lot of different configurations on a lot of different columns, but in essence, this is exactly what a rolling total is, that's how it works. And we were able to partition based off of this column. We don't have to use partition by. We could do this completely regardless of the partition, but I thought it was interesting to at least break it out by female versus male. So now that we know how to use a window function, let's look at some special things that you can really only do with window functions or window like functions. So we're going to bring this down. And what we're going to do is get rid of this entire thing. And we're going to look at something called row number. Then we're going to look at rank, and then we'll look at dense rank. So it's like at row, underscore number. And this is just like an aggregate function. Like you're doing the average age or average salary or something like that. This is what we're doing. We're doing a row number. Now we're going to do this over and we'll just do everything for right now. So let's go ahead and run this and just see what it looks like. Let's bring it up. And what we're doing is we're saying, okay, we have first name, last name, gender, salary. That's all great. Then we get to row number. And we're doing a row number based off of everything. It doesn't matter what it is. So we're starting at one, which is the very first row. And we go all the way down to the bottom, just like an employee ID. So let's actually add that. Let's do DM dot employee underscore ID, just like this. So we have this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, nine, to eleven. Now if you remember on this table, we are missing Ron Swanson. So it kind of skips that. But",

We'll do partition by, let me spell that right, partition by the gender. Now we're going to add a row number based off the gender. But again, it's broken out or partitioned by gender. Let's look at this. Now it goes for the females, one, two, three, four. Then for the males, it restarts one, two, three, four, five, six, seven. Now this is just in a random order based off how the, you know, data was stored in the table itself. Now what if we wanted to kind of rank these based off of the highest salary first down to the lowest salary? You nailed it. We just add an order by, we'll order by salary. And if you want to do it from highest to lowest, giving the highest salary, the number one and the lowest salary, you know, later down, we'll do descending. And let's run this. And you'll see that for female, we're still partitioning by gender. For female, the highest salary is one, next is two, three and then four. Then for males, the highest salary is one all the way down to seven. So that's what row number does. It just gives a row number based off of whatever you're partitioning by or ordering by in your window function. Now let's go over here and add a comma. And we're going to add, and let's go down just a hair. Let's add rank. So I want to do rank and we'll do our parentheses. Now rank is going to give it more of an official rank. And let's see how this works. So we'll do rank and we'll do over partition by salary descend at the exact same thing. And while we're here, I'm going to rename these. I'm going to say as, as row underscore num, and we'll call this one rank underscore num. So let's go ahead and run this. And it looks very, very, very similar except for one small thing. This right here. When we're using the row number, whatever we are partitioning by, it's not going to have duplicate rows within that partition. It just won't. So even if there's 50,000 right here, it's just going to automatically assign it based off of something that is running in the background, whether it's the order of how the data stored in the table or some other order by that you are using on the table. Now rank is a little bit different because rank is going to take it just like it did the run-up except when it encounters a duplicate based off of the order by, which is the salary. It's going to assign it the same number. So this is five and five. What's unique about rank is that the next number is not going to be the next number numerically. It's going to be the next number positionally. So this is one, two, three, four, five. This is kind of like a six. And then it goes to seven. So it skips number six. Now there's another one. Let's copy this rank. There's another type of rank called dense rank. And we'll do dense underscore rank. So we'll do dense underscore rank. Let's run this. And let's pull this up. There we go. Now dense rank is ever so slightly different than rank in the fact that when it gets down to duplicates, it's still going to duplicate them. So it's going to have a five and a five, but it's going to give the next number numerically, not positionally. That is the only real difference between rank and dense rank. And again, row number is just not going to have duplicates. It's going to give it its own unique within that partition. So I know I just threw a lot at you, but that's row number, rank and dense rank in a nutshell. And you can review this, mess around with it, all these things because these are actually really,",

    "text": "Hello everybody and welcome to the first lesson in the advanced MySQL tutorial series. Today we are going to be looking at CTEs. Now CTEs stand for common table expression. They're going to allow you to define a sub query block that you can then reference within the main query. Now that may not make perfect sense but we've looked at sub queries in the past or in previous lessons in the intermediate series. So you kind of understand that it's kind of like a query within a query except we're going to name the sub query block. And it'll be a little bit more standardized, a little bit better formatted than actually using a sub query. Let's take a look at the basics of writing a CTE. Let's pull this down really quickly. And all we're going to do is we want to create this as a CTE. So what's they with and that is our keyword to define our CTE. So we're going to say with and then we're going to name our CTE. And we'll just call it CTE and we'll do underscore example. And then we're going to say as so this is how we define it and now we need to actually put it in parentheses. Now you can do this in several different ways. I'm going to do it kind of like this just to really emphasize that this is within the CTE. Now CTEs are unique because you can only use the CTE immediately after you create it. So if you come right down here and we come right below it we'll say select everything. And we're going to say from CTE example. We'll say from CTE example. And let's bring this back up. Now if we run this we're going to get the exact same output. Now this should seem pretty familiar almost like we're using a sub query. And within our sub query we have this right here. We're kind of building our own little table. And then we can query off of it down below. So we can come down here and let's actually change the names in here. We're going to say average underscore cell. And we'll change all of these real quick just because don't I don't like having to actually put the you know the tick marks. I don't like doing that. So here we're going to say max. Then we'll say men. And then we'll say count. And let's go ahead and run this again. And so now we have these different names. And when we come right here we can say select and then we'll just do something really simple. We'll just do the average of average underscore cell. So the average salary. And let's run this. And so this is the average between both the males and the females. Kind of the purpose of these CTEs is to be able to perform more advanced calculations. Something that you can't easily do or can't do at all within just one query. Another reason to use a CTE is just the readability. You can absolutely write this using a sub query. And let's do that really quickly. And it's just going to be a little bit tougher to read and look at. So let's come right up here. We're going to say. From and we'll do right here. We'll say select everything. We'll do like average. Sal. From here and we're going to need to name this. We'll say do example underscore sub query. I'll get rid of this. And then we just need to get rid of this. And we can run this query. And we get the exact same output. Now if I form out of this exactly the same just like this and the names down there. If we look at this, these syntax is just a little bit more difficult to read. We're selecting the average of average. Sal from and then we have our sub query right here. And then we're naming it at the bottom. If we scroll up and compare this, this one just looks a lot better. Now when you're writing in my SQL, sometimes it doesn't matter if it looks pretty or not as long as it gets a job done. That is true, especially if you're just going to be using it yourself. But in a more professional environment when you're using this in your actual job, they're going to be people who've been using this for 10, 20 years. And they're going to expect you to write it well. They don't want it to be really messy. They aren't most likely going to want it to be written like this. I've been using it for quite a long time. And I must prefer CTE's over sub queries just visually. And it makes it a lot quicker to actually read through. So that's just one of the reasons, although you get the exact same output. Now there is some additional functionality within CTE's as well. Now one thing that I mentioned just a second ago is that when you build a CTE, you can only use it immediately after. You can't use it right below it. So let's go ahead and let's copy this query. And we're going to bring it right here. If w",

You can't use it right below it. So let's go ahead and let's copy this query. And we're going to bring it right here. If we try to run this, and let's do this, we're going to get an error. And let's pull this up. It says table parks and rack dot CTE example doesn't exist. So we're looking for a table called CTE example in our database, but it's not there. Now the reason this happens is because you're creating a CTE. You're not creating a permanent object like a temp table, which we'll look at in the next lesson. And you're not creating a real table and you're not creating a view. You're really not creating anything. It's just a common table expression to create this table right here. This basically almost like a temporary table almost. But then you're just using it to query off of it. You're not saving it. You're not storing it in memory. You're not really doing anything with it. It's just like writing a regular query. So this is why you can only write it immediately after creating the CTE. You can't write it down below and reuse it. Because it's just like calling a query that you wrote before. It just isn't going to work. Now the next thing that I want to take a look at, and let's copy this down here. Next thing I want to take a look at is that you can actually create multiple CTEs within just one. So if we wanted to do a more complex query or joining more complex queries together, we can do that all within one CTE. So let's come right here. Let's get rid of all of this. We're going to say from the demographics table, we're going to say where birth underscore date. And let's just do larger than 1985, dash 01, dash 01. So we have one query. We'll take a few columns from this table. So we'll take the employer or employee ID. We'll take the gender and the birth underscore date. So this is one query and we're filtering just based off of this birth date. Now when we create this, this is the CTE example. But we can have a comma here. When we come down below, then we can say CTE underscore example two. And I need to combine that. So two. And then we can say as and then we have another query. So then right here, we could say select everything. We'll change that a second from employee to salary. And then the salary will just do a simple one. We'll do where salary is greater than 50,000. And we'll actually just take the employee underscore ID and the salary. Now if I come right down here, I can say select everything from CTE example, which is, and let me scroll up if we can see everything. That's our original. Our CTE example is this first query right here. Then we're creating our second one right here. And we can join basically on these two commentable expressions. So now we can say join, and then we'll do CTE underscore example two. And then you change that X. And then we'll say on. Then we're just going to do CTE example dot employee underscore ID. It's equal to CTE example two dot employee underscore ID. And not an equal sign, but a dot. There we go. Now if we run this, it should work. And we can pull this down and look at our output. Now this is just an example. This isn't a real use case because of course, we just join these two tables together normally. But you can imagine you have a much more complex query, or you're doing a lot of functionality within this table. And you just want a certain subsection of this table. And you're wanting to combine those. This is how you can do that with a CTE. So now we have all of our information right here. And that can be extremely, extremely helpful. Now one last thing that I want to show you, I'm going to go all the way back up really quickly right here. Let's run this one more time. Let's actually take everything. And let's run this. So here we have our gender avera",

So here we have our gender average salary, max salary, min salary, and count salary. The last thing that I want to show you, and this is more of something that's just somewhat helpful. You don't have to actually do it in your main query. Is before we went in here and we changed all the column names by doing an alias by saying as and then saying the average salary. And the as is just implied here. But we're changing this via an alias. We don't have to do this. In fact, we could come right here and we could do a parentheses. We could call it gender. We could call it average underscore salary, max underscore salary, min underscore salary, and let's do count underscore salary. So now if we were to run this, let's change this. I'll do capital on this one. If we wanted to run it like this, when we run this, it'll change all of those names to what we have it right here. So this will be the default. This will overwrite the column names that you have in your actual CTE expression or the query that you have within your CTE. So that is all we're going to take a look at in this lesson on CTEs. These are very, very helpful. Definitely help with more complex queries. And they're just really easy to read and understand, which is why I personally use them a lot. In the next lesson, we're going to be taking a look at temp tables and we'll also compare temp tables to CTEs and we'll take a look at the difference.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at temporary tables. Now temporary tables are tables that are only visible to the session that they're created in. So if I create a temp table right now and I exit out of my SQL and I come back in, it's not going to be there anymore and we'll look at that in just a little bit. Now temporary tables can be used for a lot of things but how I've mostly used them especially as a data analyst is restoring intermediate results for complex queries somewhat like a CTE, but also for using it to manipulate data before I insert it into a more permanent table. So let's take a look at how we can create a temp table. There's two ways you can do it. I'll show you the first way which I don't think is as popular and then I'll show you the second way which is how I typically use it the most. Now the first way to create a temp table is to create a temporary table. I need to sound it out like that. It's the only way I can spell. So we're going to temp underscore table. So this is our name. Now if we just took this out, and we created a table, this would create a table in our parks and recreation database, but we don't want that. We don't want to create a temporary table that just lives inside of our memory or the memory within our computer. Now we're going to create this temporary table much like we would a regular table and we're going to need to name the columns as well as the data types. So let's do first underscore name and our data type can be var char let's say 50. We'll do a comma. Then we'll do last underscore name. We're going to keep this really simple. We'll do var char 50 again and then for our last, we'll do favorite underscore movie. And for this one needs to be longer. So we'll do var char. Let's say 100. Now let's get rid of this and let's actually run this after we do our semicolon. Let's actually run this and nothing is going to happen. Let's click refresh. Nothing is going to happen. At least you can't see it happening. Let's pull this up and you can see that create temporary table. So zero is affected, but it was created. Now in order to actually see it, we can do select everything and we'll do this from our temp table and we'll add a semicolon and then we run this and we have this empty table right here. Now what's really great about these temp tables is then you can insert data into it and it basically is like a real table except it just lives in memory and they go away after a while, but you can reuse this temp table over and over and over again. Now let's insert some data into here and then we'll take a look at this again. So let's come right down here. Let's insert data. We'll do insert into and we want to insert that into the temp table and we're just going to say values. Now we just say values. I'll use myself for this one. We'll do Alex, freeberg and what's my favorite movie? Give me a comma. That'll be Lord of, I think it's like that. Lord of the Rings, the two towers. That's probably my favorite movie of all time. Now let's go ahead and insert this data and let's pull this down here and let's run it all the way down here after we add our semicolon and when we run this, you'll notice that now we have data in here. So now we can use this table much like any real table. So that's the first way to create a temp table, not my personal favorite way, although there have been some use cases where I've done it like that. I'm going to show you the way that I typically do it. And for this, let's select everything from the employee underscore salary table. Let's run this. Now let's say I just wanted a subsection of this data to sit in this temp table where the salary is greater than let's say 50,000. Like it easily easily do this. I'm going to say create temporary table and let's do this one as salary over underscore 50k. Now one thing about naming either temp tables or CTS or subcreas or any of these things where you need to name something, I try to typically name it something that actually makes sense. So the salary over 50k is something I would actually name it in my real work. I wouldn't normally name it something like temp table. The reason for that is because when you're in a work environment and you have lots of temp tables, you're creating really advanced or procedures, really advanced queries, you have hundreds or even thousands of tables and different databases, it gets really complex. So naming conventions are actually pretty important so they become more important. The more you get entrenched in this stuff. So just something to think about. Now we're creating this temp table. Now we don't have to really insert data into it more than we're just going to select data from already existing tab",

Then we're just going to say where salary is greater than 50,000. Now I want Tom and or Jerry. I want them to be included as well. So I'll actually say greater than or equal to. So now we're creating a temporary table based off of an already existing table and we're just selecting data into this temporary table. So when we run this. Now we can select the salary over 50k and let's run this. And it works perfectly. Now the great thing about temp tables is they last as long as you are within that session. Meaning if I copy this query. Let's go to a new window. And let's paste this in here. Let's zoom in a little bit. And let's run this. It still works even in a new window. But if I'm to exit out and come back in, then it is no longer going to be working. Now let's exit out of this. Let's come back in and we'll see if these temp tables still work. Let's go ahead and exit out. Oh geez. I'm embarrassed. All right, let's go to my sequel. Let's come over here to the local instance. So now it pulls right back up. Zoom in once again on both these and let's try to pull up our salary over 50k temporary table. Let's run this. And we're not getting an output. Let's go back. It's going to say error code. The table salary over 50k does not exist. So it only lasted as long as we were within this session. So that is how we create our temp tables. And that's how we use our temp tables. Now in the last lesson, we had looked at CTEs. CTEs and temp tables both have their own use cases within my sequel. For temp tables, this is usually for the more advanced thing. So I'm usually using these and store procedures when I'm really manipulating data and I'm doing a lot more complex queries overall. And oftentimes I'll use multiple temp tables and I'm joining them together. And I'm just doing a lot of more advanced stuff with CTEs. It's typically more simple things because you can't make as advanced CTEs or as complex CTEs. So with those, I'm usually keeping it to just one level of transformation. I have my base CTE or my base sub query or query however you want to call that. And I'm changing it or doing one level of advanced thing on top of that query. That's what a CTE is really great for. Temp tables, you can just get a lot more advanced with it. They also last for then the session. And if I'm using it multiple times throughout something like a store procedure, then it makes so much sense to use a temporary table. So this has been our lesson on temporary tables in the next lesson. We're going to be taking a look at string functions.",

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at stored procedures. Stored procedures are a way to save your SQL code that you can reuse over and over again. When you save it, you can call that store procedure and it's going to execute all the code that you wrote within your store procedure. It's really helpful for storing complex queries, simplifying repetitive code and just enhancing performance overall. So let's take a look at how we can create a stored procedure. Now we're going to start by just creating a really simple query. Let me get a little bit more advanced as we go along and take a look at the different things within the store procedures that you can do. Now let's change the query. Let's say where the salary is greater than, let's do 50,000. Let's actually do greater than or equal to 50,000. We want to include Tom and Jerry as well. So let's go ahead and run this. Now what we want to do is save this really complex code within a stored procedure. Let's come right down here and we can create a super, super, super simple store procedure by just saying create procedure and pasting that. Now we just have to name it. So we have create procedure and we'll call this large underscore salaries. And then we do a closed parentheses. Now this is as simple as it can possibly be. It does not get any simpler than this. So let's go ahead and run this. And if we go down, we pull this up. You can see that it says create procedure zero is affected. It looks like it worked. And if we come over here to this refresh button, you should see now that under store procedures, it drops down. We have our large salaries. That's exactly what should have happened. We wanted to save that into our parks and recreation. Now if you wanted to be careful, you could say use arcs underscore and underscore recreation. This is not a bad idea, but you don't have to. But you can specify what database within your actual editor window. Sometimes that is helpful. But now we've created it. Now let's see how we can call it. Always to do is say call. We're going to copy this entire thing, including the parentheses. And let's end it with that's right. That's not my calling. Let's go ahead and run this. And as you can see, it worked because we got the exact output. So we actually called this store procedure in this code. Rand. So it's just a select statement. So it worked perfectly. Now you can also come over here to large salaries. And there's this little tiny little button here that looks like a lightning bolt. And if you click it, it's going to open up a different window. And we'll say call parks and recreation dot large salaries. So you can do it that way as well. But we're not going to be doing it that way. Now what we've written right here is not best practice by any means. And I'm going to copy this down here because there's a lot of different things that you need to take into account when you're creating a store procedure. For example, this right here is most likely not what you're going to be putting into a store procedure. This is super, super simple. Typically, we'll be having multiple queries. And let's see what happens if I try to put another query in here. Let's get rid of this. So we're going to select everything where the salary is greater than 50,000 and then we'll select everything where it's greater than 10,000, which is everybody. Let's call this large salaries to. So we have two different statements in here. And we want them all to be under this large salaries to let's select everything and let's run this. And we're getting an output, which is already not a good sign. But we created the store procedure and then we selected everything. So what's actually happening here? Well, it's back down. What's happening is is this is creating the store procedure and this is just some other random query. But that's not what we want. What we want is everything or both of these queries within one store procedure. The best practice is to use something called a delimiter. Now, this right here is a delimiter, the semi-colon. So the semi-colon separates our queries from one another. It tells my SQL hey, this is a different query. Don't be mixing these and cause errors. That's essentially what a delimiter does. Now we can change the delimiter by coming up here and saying delimiter. And we can change it to almost anything we want. Now, in my actual job, I've seen it done many different ways. I've seen these forward slashes. I've also seen dollar signs. This is probably the one that I've seen the most when I worked with data engineers, data scientists, database developers. You know, this one I see a lot. And then you'll come into the code and you'll say begin. And let's go over here. Let's tab all of this. And then we'll say end. Now, when we end, we're going to end it with this dollar sign. So here's what's happening. We're changing the delimiter right here to dollar sign. We're creating our store procedure. And",

Now, when we end, we're going to end it with this dollar sign. So here's what's happening. We're changing the delimiter right here to dollar sign. We're creating our store procedure. And within it, we are keeping all of this. So all of this code is going to go into this one store procedure. Then at the end, we are saying this is the end right here of this store procedure. These some I call ones no longer are the delimiter that's telling us when it is the end of the store procedure. That's what the delimiter does. Now, it is best practice at the end to change it back. Right. Let me spell it right because if you don't, then you're going to have to start using these dollar signs for everything. And how do you spell delimiter? Man, there we go. Now we've changed it back to a semicolon afterwards. So then we can go and write other queries and act appropriately. Let's go down. So this is getting closer to best practice. Let's go ahead and run this entire thing. And if we pull this up, we're not getting an output. That's a good sign. If we pull this up, it's saying we already created number two, change up to three my apologies. Let's go down here. Now we've created the store procedure three. Now let's go over here. We're going to right click on this. We're going to say alter stored procedure. And now you can see that we have both of these queries within the store procedure. Let's get rid of this and we're going to go and call this. So let's copy this large salaries three. Bring this all the way down. And let's say call that store procedure. If we run it, you'll notice we get two outputs. We have six and seven. This result six is worth greater than 50,000 or 50,000 or greater. This one is worth greater than 10,000, which is essentially the entire table. Now so far we've done everything just by writing it all out. And that's fantastic. But you can't also come over here to store procedures. You can right click and say create store procedure. Now let's actually copy this. We're just going to create the exact same thing. We'll create store procedure. And we can just paste this in here. Let's go ahead and do that. There we go. And sure we'll call it new procedure. Why not? And if we say apply, you'll notice that it generates this script right here. And we can apply it and we can create it. We will in just a second. But let's take a look at it. So we're going to use our XR recreation. That's what I was mentioning before. We're then going to say drop procedure if exists. Now this is something that I was going to show you later. And we'll just show it to you now. Sometimes it is really beneficial to write something like this before you create it. In case you've already created a store procedure with that name that you are wanting to replace. So it's checking if it's there. And if that new procedure is already there, it's just going to drop it. Then it comes down. And let me see if I can zoom in on this. And then it's going to create our delimiter, which it uses dollar signs. So my SQL is even validating what I was saying earlier. We're going to use Parks and Recreation again. And now again, we have to use instead of a semicolon, we're using dollar signs. Then we're creating the procedure, which is new procedure for saying begin. And and then it's even changing the delimiter back. So basically everything I said, this is kind of doing it for you automatically. Now when I click apply, it went ahead and execute that SQL statement. And our new one is ready. So we can go ahead and alter that store procedure. And it looks exactly the same as this one out here, which was large salaries number three. So it looks exactly the same. Now let's go ahead and get rid of this. Get rid of this. And let's go down below. The next thing I want to take a look at is something called a parameter. Now before I actually get into this, I'm going to copy all this down here because I don't want to rewrite all of it from being honest. So let's paste this in here. Now parameters are variables that are past as an input into a store procedure in the allow the store procedure to accept an input value and place it into your code. Let's take a look",

Now parameters are variables that are past as an input into a store procedure in the allow the store procedure to accept an input value and place it into your code. Let's take a look at what that actually means. Now before I do anything, I'm just going to change this to number four. So I don't forget. So let's get rid of all of this. We're going to keep it somewhat simple because we're looking at something new. Now when I say we're passing through a parameter, I'm talking about when we're calling it. So let's say we've already created this one. I'm not going to run this yet, but let's say we've created it. Let's say I want to pass in an employee ID. I want to pass in a specific person and I want to retrieve their salary. I know their employee IDs. I just want it to pull up their salary for us. So what we're going to do is we'll get rid of this. And when we're calling it, this down, when we're calling it, I'm going to pass through value like one. That's Leslie note. And then I want the salary to be the output. So I'm going to select the salary. So we're selecting salary from the employee salary. But how do we know that this one is the person we're looking for? Well, when we're actually creating this parameter, we create it right in here. That's what tells the store procedure to accept an input value when we're calling it down below. We're going to call this employee underscore ID. Now after we call it, after we name our parameter, we need to then give it a data type. So I'll call this an integer. So we're telling the store procedure when somebody calls the store procedure, they have to pass through an integer. It can't be a string or a can't be a date. It has to be an integer. Now, what we're going to go do is right down here, we'll say where the employee underscore ID, that's from this column in the actual tail will say is equal to the employee underscore ID, which is our parameter right here. Now you may be thinking that's really confusing. They're naming the exact same thing. Can I change it? The answer is yes, I actually encourage it. So there are some naming conventions that are out there that I think are helpful ones that I personally use. But remember, this is just kind of a variable parameter name. You can kind of call it whatever you want. So if I wanted to say, Huggy muffin, I could. And this could be Huggy muffin. So let's try it with Huggy muffin. I just came up with that off the top of my head. So don't judge me. But we're going to create the store procedure. And then when we call it later, we wanted to return the salary, where the employee ID right here is equal to whatever was passed through that parameter, that input parameter. And we're going to keep it as one. So it should return 75,000. Let's go ahead, we're going to create this. And now let's go right down here and we're going to run it. And we can see that that is the salary and it worked perfectly. Now, like I was saying, that is not what I would actually name it. There are some naming conventions like underscore, Param at the end. So you kind of want to keep it at least I recommend you try to keep it similar to what you're actually looking for. And you can either end it in underscore Param or there's another way you can do it, which is come right over here and do P underscore. And these are just ways that you can tell the code, or you can just be able to visually see the difference in the code. So this is just what I recommend. Then you put it right down here. Do you say where the employee ID is equal to P underscore employee ID saying this is the parameter that's being passed through and put into our actual query. So that is all we're going to take a look at in this lesson in the next lesson. We're going to be taking a look at triggers and events",

    "text": "Hello, everybody. In this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at triggers and events. A trigger is a block of code that executes automatically when an event takes place on a specific table. For example, let's take a look at these two tables. Now, when a new employee is hired, they're put into this table with their salary information and everything. But sometimes people forget or don't add their information, like, you know, who right here, they're not put into this demographics table. And we want to change that because we want to have everybody in here. So when somebody is put into this salary table, we want to automatically update with the employee ID, first name and last name into this table right here for the employee ID, first name and last name. So we're going to write a trigger when data is updated into the salary. It's going to also update the employee demographics for us. Now, let's go right down here and we're going to take a look at how we can do that. Now, if you watch the last lesson on store procedures, we'll do a lot of the same writing style or same formatting for triggers and events. So we're going to start with is the delimiter. We're just going to do that right off the bat before we get into anything. And we're going to change that to the double dollar sign. Now, the delimiter again, in case we have multiple lines of code, which we're going to have, if we have multiple lines of code when we're creating this trigger, this delimiter is going to help us have multiple queries within our create trigger statement. So this is really important. We'll just start out by doing that. Now, let's create our trigger and we do need to name this. So we'll say employee underscore insert and we'll just call it like that. That's all right. Yeah, employee insert. So we have our create trigger. We've named it. Now we need to specify what event needs to take place in order for this to be triggered. So we're going to say after an insert and an useful insert, right? After an insert on and we'll do the employee underscore salary table. So after we insert onto the employee salary table down below, we're going to write what's actually going to happen. Now, we're writing after because we're doing it where when new information is put on the salary table, it's automatically updated into the demographics table. But you could also do before, which means if data is deleted from the employee salary table, something could happen. But we're not doing any deleting or any updating. We're doing insertion. So we're going to say after an insert on. Now, the next part that we need to write is for each row. Now, this for each row means that the trigger is going to get activated for each row that is inserted. So if we had an insert statement that inserted four different people who were just hired, that means this trigger is going to be activated four times. Now, some SQL databases like Microsoft SQL Server have things like batch triggers or table level triggers that'll only trigger once for all four of them. And in my opinion, those are really, really nice. I've used those. I like them. The way that my SQL has it right here is not the most optimal way to do it. Unfortunately, but we don't have access to the batch level of the table level triggers at this time. So this is really just the setup for what we're about to write. So after it's inserted on the employee salary table for each row, what is going to happen? We're going to go down here. I want to say begin and we'll have end. Now, the code that we're going to write here is what's going to happen after this event takes place. So what we're going to do is we want to take from this table, bring this back up real quick. When we insert a new person, we want to take the employee ID, the first name and the last name and automatically put it into the demographics table. So we want to say insert and let me do tab insert into, we're going to insert into the employee underscore demographics table. And we're not taking everything. So let's actually specify what columns we're doing. We're doing employee underscore ID first underscore name. And then the last underscore name. Now, we need to specify what the values are now from the employee salary table. We're taking employee ID first name and last name, but we don't want to take all of them, right? We don't want to take every single employee ID, every single first name, every single last name. We only want to take the new values that were just inserted. Well, lucky for us, there is something that we have for this. So let's do values new parentheses. We have something called new. Now, new is going to say we're only taking the new rows that were inserted. There's also an old like this where it takes rows that were deleted or updated. But of course, for us, we're going t",

Now, new is going to say we're only taking the new rows that were inserted. There's also an old like this where it takes rows that were deleted or updated. But of course, for us, we're going to be using new. So we'll say new dot employee underscore ID, new dot first underscore name, then new dot last underscore name. And we'll close that then we'll come down here and we'll do our delimiter and we'll change this as well. We'll say delimiter back to a semicolon. Now, we're getting this error because we need this right here. So let's recap what we've created. Then we'll actually create it and try it out. So we're creating our trigger called employee insert. After a row is inserted into the employee salary table for each row, here's what's going to happen. We are going to insert into the employee demographics table, the employee ID, the first name and the last name. Those are the columns that we're going to insert into. Then we're taking the values new dot employee ID, new dot first name and new dot last name. Now, my SQL understands that when we say new, we're talking about the events that takes place as the data that's being inserted. It just knows that. So let's go ahead and create it. We're going to run this and it should work. Let's pull this up. It says create triggers that worked. Now, the thing about triggers that's unfortunate, it doesn't have its own little section under here, right? But it does have under the employee salary right here and then under the triggers. So we can find it, which is great. So we have this employee insert. If we right click, we can't really do anything with it. That's the unfortunate thing. We can't alter it. We can't change it. We can't drop it. We can't do anything. That's the unfortunate part. Well, it's actually tested. So now we're going to say insert into and we're going to insert into this employee salary. That's how we're going to trigger it. So insert into the employee salary. And then we'll do employee underscore ID. These are all the columns. The first underscore name, last underscore name, occupation, bear with me for a second. Then we have salary and then department underscore ID. So this is what we're inserting into. Now we have to do our values. Now this should be shorter. Hopefully we'll do 13. We'll call him a genre of Fio. There we go. Last name is Saperstein. Just like that. And not actually just like that. That's not spelled right. So we have Saperstein. His occupation is entertainment 720 C. Oh, how much is he making? Let's say a million, is that a million? A million. He's making a million dollars. And he's really not part of any department. So we're just going to have no. So what we're about to do is we're only inserting on the employee salary table. But we're putting all the values that we need into the appropriate places. Let's add a semicolon. Let's go ahead and run this. Make sure it worked. It says insert into and then one row affected. Now let's come back up. Let's look at our salary table. First, and get rid of this. If we pull this up, you can see genre of Fio Saperstein. He was added. Let's go to the demographics. Is the moment of truth. Let's see if it worked. And as you can see, it worked perfectly. We have genre of Fio Saperstein. Now they do need to come back and fill this information. But it's already in here kind of queuing them up saying, hey, we need this person's age, gender, birth date, all that other information. So that is how we can create a trigger based off of a specific table. And then when it happens, it just automatically does it for us. We don't have to really think about it. We just know that we've created a trigger and we can actually go and insert data on that table. And that trigger is going to work. It's going to do what it's supposed to do. And that's really, really helpful in the real world when you're working with a ton of tables, a ton of things need to be automatically done. And you don't want to have to manually do this. So having these triggers can save you a ton of time. Now let's scr",

So having these triggers can save you a ton of time. Now let's scroll down and we're going to take a look at events. Now event is kind of similar to a trigger. A trigger happens when an event takes place. Whereas an event takes place when it's scheduled. So this is more of a scheduled automator rather than a trigger that happens when an event takes place. These can be fantastic for a lot of things like when you're importing data. You can pull data from a specific file path on a schedule. You can build reports that are exported to a file on a schedule. You can do it daily, weekly, monthly, yearly, really whatever you'd like. It's just super helpful for automation in general. Now let's say the Pawnee Council comes up with some new legislation. They need to save some money, especially in the Parks and Rec department. We're just spending too much or they're spending too much. And what they want to do is retire people who are over the age of 60 immediately and give them lifetime pay. So what we want to do is create an event that checks it, let's say every month or every day. And then if they're over a specific age, we are then going to delete them from the table and they will be retired. This is a fake example. So you know, go with it. So what we're going to do is come right down here. We'll select everything from employee demographics. And let's run this. And let's pull this up. So let's say if they are over the age of 60, which unfortunately is Jerry Gurgertz, like I don't make the rules. But if they're over the age of 60, they're going to be automatically retired. So let's come right over here. We're going to say create event. And we'll call this the delete, delete underscore retirees. Now before we are creating the trigger, we are saying based off of a specific event. But here we're going to schedule it. We're going to say on schedule. And then we're going to say every and we could do one month. Maybe we'll look every single month. But here we'll do let's do every 30 seconds, every 30 second. Now we're going to go down. We'll say do and this is going to say here's what needs to happen every 30 seconds. So we'll say begin and end. Now what's going to happen every 30 seconds is we're just going to start with a select statement. And I'll just copy this actually. We'll start with a select statement of them. We'll update it to a delete statement. But we'll come right here. We'll say where the age is greater than or equal to 60. So if we just run this query right here, that's only one person as Jerry Gurgich. Now if we want to write this correctly, we'll do the delimiter. We'll have the dollar signs. We'll have the dollar sign right down here as well. And we'll say the limiter back to a semicolon. Now every 30 seconds, we don't want to select people who are that age. We want to delete. So let's go right here. We're going to change this because now we know it should be deleting the right person. And we're going to go ahead and create this event. Let's go ahead and run this. And let's make sure it was created properly. It looks like create event zero is affected. This should be working. Let's go back up to the demographics table. And let's run this.

That was unfortunately, punny council's rule. Now really quickly, if that did not work, let's say you couldn't create your event at all. Let's go down here. I'm going to show variables. And we're just like this. I'm going to show you how you may need to fix this. So we can say where variables is like. And then we'll say event. It's just like this. So I have event scheduler where the value is on. If yours is off, which sometimes that can happen, you're just going to update this to on. Now, another issue could have happened.",

If yours is off, which sometimes that can happen, you're just going to update this to on. Now, another issue could have happened. And I just want to explore this for just one second. You may not have permissions to delete things. If you do not come right up here, let's try to figure this out together. It's actually edit references. And I want to say it's right here into the SQL editor at the very bottom. Yep. So safe updates rejects updates and elites with no restrictions. This needs to be unchecked. So go to preferences, go to the SQL editor, down at the bottom and click this. If that didn't work, now if everything worked perfectly, you don't need to change a thing. But if it didn't, I just wanted to work through some troubleshooting that you may just have to Google or chat GPT or something to try to figure out. So that is how we can create an event in my SQL to run on a schedule. Now, typically you wouldn't do it on every 30 seconds. You do something like every one month or every one year or you know, a longer time frame. But you get the picture of what we're trying to do. So that is how we create triggers and events. And this is also the end of the advanced MySQL series. If you made it this far, absolutely fantastic work. In the next two lessons, those are going to be our projects that we're going to work on for this series. We'll have a data cleaning project and we'll have an exploratory data analysis project. Both of those are going to include a ton of things that we've looked at in this series and even some new things that we didn't look at in the actual lessons themselves. So thank you guys for watching. I hope you enjoyed this entire series. If you did, be sure to leave a like and a subscribe below. I will see you in those projects",

    "text": "What's going on everybody? Today we are starting our Excel tutorial series. Now there are so many things that you can do in Excel, so I don't know how long the series is going to be. It could be 15 or even 20 videos. But what I do know is that I'm going to be covering just about every single thing that I've used since I became a data analyst, and I want to show you how to do it. So it won't just be the more concrete things, pivot tables, charts, lead lookups, things like that. It'll also be some of the more nuanced things like how to deal with missing data or how to deal with dirty data and how to clean that up with in Excel. And so those are the things that you may not be able to do. If somebody wasn't showing you how to do it. And so that's what I'm going to try to help you because I know that that is something that you will need to do or learn how to do in Excel. Now before we get into it, I want to give a huge shout out to the sponsor of this Excel series and that is you to me. I took so many Excel courses on you to me when I was first starting out as a data analyst. And there was this one course that I kept going back to over and over again because as I got into it in my job, I realized that there were so many things that were in that course that I really need to know, but I didn't realize I needed to know it. And so I'm going to put the links to those courses in the description in case you want to take those again, huge shout out to you to me. Without further ado, let's jump on to my screen and get started with our very first Excel tutorial. All right, so I'm going to go ahead and get rid of myself. We're going to be looking at something absolutely pivotal in your data analytics career. And that is pivot tables. And I think that's really appropriate. It is probably one of the most commonly used things I think that data analysts use to convey information in Excel. It's super easy to group things together to display information in a very easily understandable way, especially for people who are not data analysts, right? I use this a lot for other managers or for higher ups who don't want to get into SQL or you know, aren't super tech savvy and like Python or Tableau. They just want to in Excel. And so I use it all the time for that reason. And so we're going to be using this data set right here, bike store sales in Europe. I will include this link in the description. We're not going to look at the column just yet. We're going to download it. I've already downloaded it a few times, but we are going to go to our downloads. We're going to open it up. And we're going to open up sales right here. And give it a second. All right, perfect. And so here's what it looks like, at least on my screen. I'm going to spread it out just a little bit. And really quickly, let's take a very quick glance at this. So we have a date, a day, a month, the year. So some some date information. Then we have some customer age information. So how old was the customer? Again, this is bike sales. So what did you know, what did they buy? And they have some demographic information. So this is their age group. We have the gender, country, state, the product category, the subcategory, the actual product that was purchased. And then we have things like, you know, how much these things cost the quantity that was that was ordered. So we have order quantity, unit cost, unit price. Then we have the profit, cost, and revenue. All things that we almost everything in here, we can in some way put into a pivot table. Now, I'm not going to go through every single variation of that. But we are going to be looking at a lot of this revenue over here. Because I think it's it's pretty easy to show the value of a pivot table especially with currency or money. So what we're going to do to get started is we're going to go up to insert and we're going to click on insert. And then we are going to click on pivot table. Now really quick, there is a recommended pivot tables. And if you click on that, what will come up is some recommendations that Excel gives based on the data that you have. And it can kind of give you some ideas of of what you can do with pivot tables. It's going to generate a for you. We're not going to do that. We're going to build our own. But let's click on pivot table. And it's going to auto select basically everything. And that's fantastic. But what if it doesn't come like that, I just erase it. If it doesn't come like that, you can click right here. You can kick excuse me, you can click control shift and then the right arrow and then the down arrow. And that is going to select all of our data. And you have right here",

You can kick excuse me, you can click control shift and then the right arrow and then the down arrow. And that is going to select all of our data. And you have right here a new worksheet or an existing worksheet. We're going to create a new worksheet. Just tends to get too clogged up if we put it on the same worksheet that already has a lot of data in it. So right over here are pivot table fields. And these are all of our columns that we just looked at. And we're going to be able to select those and kind of drag and drop. Now if you just took the tab low tutorial series that I just finished doing last week, then this is going to be pretty familiar. You're going to start seeing a little bit of hopefully some patterns about how the data is kind of displayed. And so we have our filters down here. We have columns, rows, values. All these things we will be using. I'll show you how to use today as well as some additional things. One thing that we want to start with for this demonstration is we're going to be looking at kind of the these bottom ones right here profit, cost, and revenue. And we're going to be doing that per country per country and state and we'll kind of do some drill downs. And I'll show you how those work. So for just to start out, we're going to take the country right here. And you'll see it populate right over here. In fact, let me zoom in maybe once. Yeah, that should be fine. I don't know if I want to. I might zoom in again in just a little bit. So we have our country and it's just like this very very simple. Oops. Now I'm going to include the state. Now I'm going to drag this all the way and I'm going to put it under you can put it above or you can put below. I'm going to put it below. It definitely makes the most sense there. Now when you do that, it kind of populates it in an expanded way. But you can collapse this very easily. We're going to go right here. We're going to right click. We're going to go down to expand and collapse. And we're going to collapse the entire field. And so now here are all of our all of our countries as they were formed. Now each of them has this plus sign to the left. And if you click on it, now we can go and we see this state that we added to these rows. And what this is going to do is it kind of is like a roll up or it's like a grouping. And so if you have taken the SQL tutorial series and you've done things with Group-by, this is very similar to that. And if you've done the tab load tutorial series, it's kind of like a drill down. It's very, very similar. So you can drill into the information. So we can put some values in here. And what that's going to do is that's going to kind of create some context to what this what we're grouping by. So just for visual purposes, let's add this revenue. So this is the revenue that is bike, bike sales revenue, right? That's what we're looking at. So this is the sum of the revenue for these bike sales per country. Now if we drop down right here, we can see that in Australia, New South Wales had 92, was a 9,203,495 dollars. Gwinsland had 5 million, you know, etc, etc. So now we can break it down. We can't we don't just have to look at Australia. We can now drill down even further to the actual state as what they're calling it. The actual state within Australia. And so it's super, super useful and you can do that for every single one. And so we can look at Canada, we can look at France, and we can really drill down into the revenue for each of countries as well as the states within them. Now over here, this is not the most pretty, it just says sum of revenue and then it has some numbers. Not the most pretty thing I've ever seen. Really quick, we can go like we can kind of highlight over these and we can go back to home. You can do it in a couple different ways. We can go to home and we'll type currency. Now it has these two dot zero zeros at the end. You can",

Now it has these two dot zero zeros at the end. You can get rid of those really easily by going like that. Already this looks quite a bit better just visually, especially if you're looking at it in, you know, dollars, you can change the currency to different currencies if you want to do that. Now we don't just have to do the sum of revenue. We can do a lot of different things. So let's go to the value field settings. So we can customize this name. So we can do revenue, oops, we could have I get spell revenue per country. That's fine. That, you know, it's just a place holder to try to show you, but we don't have to just do that. You know, we could do the count, the average, the max, the min, we can do just about anything we want. But let's keep it the sum right now. And if we want to, we can show this value as different things. So we percentage, percentage of column total, percentage of row total. Let's do really quick just for demonstration purposes, the percentage of grand total. So when we do that, we can see that the United States, the per revenue per country, United States has 32% just between these, you know, these countries. And Australia has the next one. So, you know, it might be kind of hard to glance at this really quickly to know who has the highest. But what we can do is we can go right here, we can go to sort, and we can do largest to smallest. And there we have the United States on top. Now when you do it right here, it's not sorted largest to smallest. You'd have to go in again, like sort and do largest to smallest. And so now we can see that California has the, has the, you know, biggest percentage. They're pulling in 20% of that 32% of revenue. So I'm just going to click Ctrl Z a few times and get us back to where we just were. And what I want to do is I want to show you a few different things pretty quickly. So we want to pull in this profit in this cost. And so I'm going to pull in this cost next. And then I'm going to pull in this profit again. I'm going to change the currency on this. And I'm not going to change the names right now, but you absolutely can do that. Now the revenue is the, how much is actually being sold? So, you know, for the United States, it was 27 million. Now the cost is how much did it cost you manufacture or store? Or distribute all of these products. So that was 16 million. And the profit is actually how much money is being made. At the end of the day, after, you know, all their costs, after all their employee costs, after everything, they're still making, the United States is still making $11 million. Now you might look at this and you might say, well, you know, I can kind of glance at it and say, know that this profit is correct based off these two numbers. But we can do a calculated field. If you remember what calculated fields are, that's something from Tableau, very, basically the exact same thing. And so we can create an additional column right here that is a calculated field that can add and subtract these things to make sure that our numbers are adding up correctly. So let's do that really quickly. Let's go to Pivot Table Analyze. We're going to go over to fields, items, and sets and go to calculated field. Now we can name this anything. And I'm just going to for demo purposes, I'm going to say, oops, Calculated Field Demo. I'm sure yours will be different. Now, if you want to, you can go in here and this is the formula. It's almost like, you know, we haven't looked at formulas that this is our first tutorial. But you know, when we look at formulas, it's basically the same thing as writing it inside of a cell. But here it gives us kind of this open text to do how we do what we want with it. Now what we're going to do is we're going to do revenue. I'm going to insert that.",

I'm going to do revenue. And so that's the very large number. And then we're going to subtract and we're going to subtract our cost. I'm going to insert that. And let's do this and click OK. So this is our calculated field demo column that we just created. And as you can see, it matches our sum of profit column exactly. And that's exactly what we want to see. We want to kind of check to make sure that this revenue and cost fields are generating the correct profit. And sometimes those are off. And so it's really good to kind of check those and have that additional column. You probably wouldn't have this if you were going to submit this to somebody just so you know, now that this is an actual column, you can't go here and do something like cut or or and paste it over here. You know, that's not I won't let you do that. What it is is now an actual column. And so we can go and remove that. And we can add it back at any moments. So if we want to go back and add that, oops, add that down here, we can do that because we've created that column. It's now permanently there unless we go and delete all of that data. And so we can just click this check mark and it will get rid of it for us. All right. Now the last thing that we have not used down here is the filters. Now the filters is exactly what it sounds like. It's going to allow you to filter on certain things. But probably not things that you already have included in your pivot table. So if you add something like the country down here, it's going to kind of expand everything. And then if you then go and filter on it, it kind of breaks it down. That's really not what the filter is kind of used for or meant for. For example, right up here, we have customer gender. Okay. So let's take the customer gender and we'll put it in this filters. Now we can see all of the revenue, all of the cost, all the profit, and we can do that based off of the gender. So we can filter by a gender, not really having to change anything about our pivot table. And so at a super quick glance, we can see that the males are the profit from the males is 16.487 million. And the profit from the females is 15.733 million. So at a super basic level at a really quick glance, we can see that the men or the males are, you know, spending a little bit more than the females by about 700,000. Now let's go ahead and create one more pivot table. We're going to create a pivot table right over here. Let's go back to these sales right here again, control shift right down. It's going to select all of our data and we'll click OK. So one thing that we're going to look at is we're going to use some of this date information right here. So let's select our country just like we did before. And what we want to do is see, you know, what year were we performing our best? When were we doing our absolute best with, oops, let me go back with our sales. So I'm going to select the year and put that in our columns. And so now we have 2011 through 2016 and we want to look at our revenue. Let's put our revenue right down here. And now we have all of our revenue knots. Again, make this into a currency. Just like that. And super quickly, now we can get a really quick glance at how Australia was doing each year. And we can see that there was a huge uptick in 2013 and a huge uptick in 2015. That didn't happen for every single country. It did go up for most countries very slightly for some. But we can see on a large scale from year to year what that's like. And so within just a few minutes, we're able to create some really useful pivot tables that anybody could look at and understand. And that's really the biggest use of these pivot tables is that you can kind of group",

I hope that I was able to walk through it and help you better understand how pivot tables work and how you can use them when you are working with in Excel. Thank you guys so much for watching.

And if there are ones that you really want me to do and you think that I missed, put it in the comments below and I will see those and I'll try to make a list of those and make another video on formulas and include all of those as well. And now before we jump into the actual tutorial, I want to give a huge shout out to the sponsor of the series and that is Yudini. You guys already know if you watched any of my videos that I absolutely love Yudini. I mean, honestly, they were the ones who got me started and were able to give me affordable courses for me to get started as a data analyst. I learned SQL and Excel and Python, all through Yudini courses. And so if you were looking for a platform to take a course, I absolutely recommend you look at Yudini. They have fantastic sales going on right now, especially during the holiday season in this new year. And so if you're looking to take a full-fledged Excel course, I have some of my favorites in the description below. And now without further ado, let's jump on my screening and get started with a tutorial. All right. Now before we start, I want to say that this is not like every other tutorial that I have created. This one is very streamlined. Okay. So I already know exactly what I'm going to do. There's not going to be much messing around. I've left little notes here and there. And I'm going to try to get through it because there's a lot of them to get through. So all these ones at the bottom. Now these are ones that I use a lot that I think are useful. Again, if you know other ones that you use a lot, the thing that I should be using, which I know there are ones that I left out of here, you know, put it in the comments.

So you can get a feel for how they work and how they're actually used and you can mess around with it yourself. So as you can see at the bottom, we're going to start with Max Min. And then we're going to go on to some more, I think a little bit more difficult things. And all these things are super useful. I'll try to talk about how you can actually use it as we go through it. Some are super self explanatory, but some may not be. So this one, I think, is super self explanatory. But again, one that you're going to use all the time. And so what we can do is we can say equal. And that's how you kind of start off saying this is going to be a formula in this cell. Equal means I am now creating a formula. And we're going to say M A X and I'll hit tab. And so it'll kind of populate in right here if you've never seen a formula before. It'll kind of give you what the inputs need to be. So it's going to say max of number one, number two, etc, etc. What we're going to do is we're going to give a range. So we're going to go from here down to here. You don't have to close the parentheses, but you can. I'm going to and then you hit enter. And so for this date, it's going to give us the max date. Now these are the start dates for these people right here. And so if we just kind of glance through here, we can see that 2013 was the last year. And this one is actually the latest in that year. And so it gave us the correct one. The men is going to do the exact opposite. It's going to give us the smallest. And so we'll give it the same range. We'll close the parentheses. And it's going to say December 7th of 1995. And we can see that. That is correct. So Michael Scott started in 1995, the earliest of all the employees. And you can do the exact same thing for really any of thes",

What's what I do? Oh, I did the wrong range, didn't I? No, I didn't do the wrong range. It's just there it goes. This column was a date range or a date column for whatever reason. Let me get rid of that. And then we can do equals men. And we'll do again. We'll do the salary. And at a quick glance, we can see that Pambesley is making the least. And 65,000 is Michael Scott who's making that. So super simple. It shows the max. It shows the men. You can select a range. There you go. Let's move on to if and if. Now if is I think pretty straightforward. So all you're going to do is you're going to say, if this, then that if is a little bit different. So if you can you can put multiple conditions. And as we're writing it, I'll show you kind of what it's the conditions that need to be met. All right, so we're going to click right here. We're going to say equal. We're going to do if tab. And we need a logical test. And so we're going to give it a range or or or something. We're going to say if it's equal greater to something like that, then we're going to say if the value is true, what's the what is going to be the output or if the values false, what's going to be the output. So let's do this right here. We'll do this age range. And so if they are greater than let's say let's do 30. If they're greater than 30, we're going to do a comma. And so if the value is true, what should be the output? If they're greater than 30, we're going to call them old. And then if it is false, so if they're younger than 30, what should it say? And we're going to say young. And we'll close the parentheses. And there you go. So if they're over 30, then they are going to have or if they're younger than 30, they're going to have young. Now this is something where you would need to specify if you want 30 and over or over 30. We chose over 30. So 30 is not included in that. So they're going to be young. Now let's get we don't actually need to these. That's pretty self-explanatory. The ifs is a little bit different, right? You can have multiple conditions. So let's open that up real quick. So ifs. And now we have a logical test value if that's true, then you can do logical test two value if that's true. So you can have multiple, multiple, multiple things. Now this one is a little bit different in this one. Oops, let me get out of this. In this one, you had a value of true, a value of false. Ifs does not have that. Ifs is going to give you different ranges in different specific conditions. And you can't say if this one's false, you're just going to have multiple conditions. So let's do equals and ifs tab and we'll do our first logical test. So let's do if the salesman or if that equals to salesman, we're going to say, we're going to spawn with sales. So that's if the value is true. That's what we want the output to be. Now we're going to go on to our logical test two. So you're going to see this pattern, right? If this is our conditional or logical test. So if this is true, this is what's going to be returned. So you'll notice that it's just a pretty simple pattern. We can just do random things. So if it's equal to sales, I will just do the same one. If that is equal to, let's say HR, we can say fire immediately. And now we're going to say if it's equal to regional manager, then we say give Christmas bonus. And we'll close the parentheses and let's say we get. So as you can see, there's no default value for true false like like this one. There was a logical test. And if it was true, there was a value. And if it was false, there was a value. So for every single one, you'll get a value for this one, that's not exactly going to happen. As you can see, there are these NA's. N",

But if it was part of that if statement, then it got something. And so that is how the if works. Now let's move on to length. This is exactly what we're going to do. But you know, some of the uses for this for the length, I've used it for a lot of different things. One thing that I've used it for in the past, and you know, max and if you can use it for almost anything, length is, there's a lot of different use cases. One, I used to work with a lot of customer data or patient data. They had like social security numbers. And if there was bad social security numbers, we didn't want to include that. And so we do like the length of that. And if a social security number was, let's say, 10 numbers or 11 numbers, where it should only be nine or, you know, every minute they are, I think it's nine. Then we know that that social security number is incorrect. And then we can get rid of that or discard it from our results. That's just an example, right? So for this, oops, what I do that, I did controls you to undo that if you didn't know how to do that. So we're going to do equals LEN, which is length. And again, if you didn't see that, it returns a number of characters in a text string. So let's go right here and let's go to, let's go to their last name. And we'll give it a range. So it's going to tell us how many characters are in that string. So for how per its seven characters, for Flenderson, its 10 characters, and we're",

If you look at the length of the phone numbers and there's ones that are like 12 numbers long, you know, those might not be ones that are accurate and you need to go look at them and see if you want to include them in your results or your output. So that is how length is done. Let's move right over to the left and right. I might be going a little fast, but you know, keeping it, keeping it alive, keeping us on our feet. So let's keep going. Left and right are kind of like substrings. If you've taken the SQL tutorial series that I've done, substring is where you can choose a certain part of the text string and you can extract data from that. And you usually have to reference a certain number, so a certain amount of characters. That's the exact same thing except unfortunately, there's no substring. There's substitute, but there's no substring. Left and right is really the closest thing that we have. So let's kind of take a look real quick and see what we can do. So we're going to do left and it's going to say returns a specified number of characters from the start of a text string. So we're starting from the very far left. And we need to choose our text and then choose the number of characters that we're going to be looking over. So let's go over here and let's just choose, you know, start simple. We'll get a little bit more advanced. So we have, this is our text range. So these are the ones that we want to look at. And then how many characters do we want to look forward? And we'll just choose three. That's an example. And so you can see it takes the first three characters from every single thing. Now you can also do this with numbers. It doesn't just have to be, you know, name with actual words or letters. You can do the exact same thing. So you can say, right? And we're going to choose our string. And let's do this one. So, you know, all of them start with 100. And we'll just say, we want to take the last one. So this one is going to start from the very far right and go over one character. So right here, you can see this is a range. And I just chose one. So starting from the very far right, we go over one character. And that's what we take. And so that can definitely be useful. Another one that you can do. And this one is one that I have used so many times. I mean, honestly, countless times in actually using this in my job. So we're going to go for the right. And we're going to look at a date. So, you know, sometimes you have these date structures month, month, day, day, year, year, year, or year, you know, day, month, year, all these diff",

And so we want to come in here and we're just going to extract the oops, I want to make that a range. We want to extract the year of the start dates. So we're going to do that. And then we're going to go over four. We want to take the first four characters from the right to give us the entire year. Let's do that. And now we can see exactly the year. And this can be just super, super useful. This is again, one that I've used a lot. And so that is one that you might want to remember in case you're ever doing analysis on, you know, start and end dates or anything with date data. Again, one that I highly recommend remembering. Let's go over to date to text. I actually probably should have included that before because I actually used it in this one. If you notice right here, this is a text. So in this one, we just did that was a text. You can't do this right on start and end dates when it's a date format. And let me show you. So this is a date. Now, if I do equals and you know, we just did this. Let's do on the end date. And I'll do the whole range. Give me a second. And we'll do four. It's giving us completely random numbers. Why is that? Because underneath the date range, there are numbers, right? So if I go right here and I make this general, it's going to have a numbers and look, these are the first four characters from the right. And so it's doing what it's supposed to do, but it's not doing what we actually want. And that's the issue. So how can we convert this? Now, there are a ton of different ways. But the quickest, probably the easiest, besides actually writing, writing it out like this, like 11-2-2001, which then converts it to a date format. But what you can do, you know, just so you know, you can create it as a text, you can do 11-2-2001. And now, it will stay a text string. And as you can tell, these are a little bit different, because this one is formatted or situated on the right and this one's on the left. That's how you can tell the difference. Now, if you don't want to do it by hand, completely manually and waste hours of your time, you can do it in a very simple way. So we're going to do text. So this is the exact formula that we're going to use. Let's get rid of that one. There we go. So we're going to do equals, we're going to do oops, text. It says, converts a value to text in a specific number format. So for a date format, we can choose a date format and then they'll convert it to a text for us, which saves so much time. I promise you. Let's do all of these, just like we did. And then we need to tell it what the format is. If we don't, if we tell it something incorrect, it's going to give us a completely terrible output or just give us an error altogether. So this is a day day month month year year year format. And that is what we're going to do. So we're going to do DD slash mm slash yy yy and close that up. And there you go. And now, because it's in a formula, what we need to do is be this and paste it right over here. And now you can see that is a general. This is something that we can use as a string. And let's just check it just to make sure we're going to write, we're going to do th",

It's going to take you two minutes or a minute to do everything that you want to do instead of having to just do a bunch of mass to convert it to a string, which I promise you I've done it. It just takes forever. It's terrible. So that is date to text. Super helpful formula. Let's go over to trim. Now I purposefully messed up this column. Now, why do I, did I mess it up like this? Because when you're working with real data, you're going to get data like this. It's messy. It's dirty. It just has random spaces at the end for no reason. Because sometimes you're going to be working with data that is inputted by a user. It's not like a drop-down option. So imagine somebody's typing this in. They accidentally put a space. So they actually put an enter or something. And then they submit it. And this is how it's going to look in the database.

    "text": "a analyst, you're going to see stuff like this, not with maybe a last name, but all sorts of data. So we're going to go right here. We're going to say equals trim to open parentheses. Actually, this says remove all spaces from a text string, except for a single space between words. So like, you know, if it said help, or gym space, help, it won't take this space in between there. Because it kind of understands that in normal language, space is supposed to be there. So it won't do that. But we'll take that. We'll give it this range. Close that up. And there you go. Now it is nice and clean, much more usable. Now let's look at concatenate. One that I have used just way, way, way too many times. And something that I've used concatenate for and you'll see this one in a lot of demonstrations for a good reason is because a lot of people use it for this. So what you can do is you can say equals and well, let me tell you what concatenate does real quick. So concatenate does, oops, I'm totally messing up here. But it joins two or more text strings into one string. It basically joins things together and adds them together. So let's do concatenate. And we're going to add this first and last name again. One that gets used all the time, but that's because it really is useful. So you can do this and you can say, now I want to include this. So concatenating this and this. And let's take a look. So this is Jim Halpert, but it's all connected. And that's typically not how people write their names. So what we can do is you can go back in here and we can do what my demonstration of purity tells us to do, which is we're just going to add another thing in here. And if we add two parentheses, we can include anything in here. We can include a dash. We can include an exclamation point or we can just include a space. So let's just include a space really quick. And just like that, it works perfectly. And so now we have the full name. Now something that you could use it for is something like generating an email. This is something that you absolutely could do. And it's pretty simple. So I'm going to do it l",

And now I've created emails for all of these people. So just something that you can do with this. And something that it absolutely is used for. And you'll see that demonstration almost everywhere because honestly, it gets used a lot by data analysts. And so you know, just a good one to know, understanding how that that concatenation works. Let's go over to the next one. So we are going to do substitute. Now, substitutes really interesting. There are different ways you can do it. I'm going to show it to you on these dates real quick. That's what we're going to look at. So changing a date format, changing how what it's supposed to look like is absolutely something that happens all the time. And you know, sometimes you'll even get it like this. Where it'll look like it'll be messy. It'll be different. A different, I guess, format. So this one has all the other ones have slashes where these ones have dashes. And you know, what you can do is if you want to, well, let me actually go with the no instances real quick. Because this one is actually makes the most sense. So we'll do equals. And we're going to say substitute. And oops, and let me say substitute replaces existing text with new text in a text string. So if we do an open parentheses, it says we take the text, we have the old text, we have the new text, and then we have what instance or how many times or what instance are we looking at it. And I'll explain that in a little bit. So the text that we're going to be looking at is this one right here. So let's take this range. And the old is we're going to take this dash. And so let's take the dash. And then what do we want to replace it with? We want to replace it with this slash right here. I think it's a forward slash. And that's what it's called. It's called a forward slash. And we're not going to put an instance. Notice that that's in a bracket. That means it's optional. We're going to do none of that. And what it's going to do is it's going to fix this. So this one is now in the correct format that we want. And that's fantastic. That's, you know, that's what we tried to accomplish given what we had. Now let's fix that. If we want to do the exact same thing, we can say, what are we doing? Substitute. We can do substitute. We can do open parentheses. We'll give the range. And now let's say we want to change all of them to a different format. So instead of the forward slash, I'm going to keep calling it that. That's correct. We want to give it a dash. And so then we close that. And now all of them are in this new format. So it's able to substitute a specific value for a new value. And if you don't include an instance, then it'll do it to every single one in there. So let's go over here. And we're going to actually use the instance name. And I'll show you what that does. And so really quick, we'll do the exact same thing that we just did. We'll do the forward slash. And we want to replace it with this one again, this dash. But we only want to do it on the first instance of that forward slash. And so as you can see, all the ones that were replaced are the very first instance. Whereas the second instance, which is the second time it appears in the string does not get touched. So if we take this, and we put it right over here, and we move it to two, it's kind of the opposite. So the first one wasn't touched. The second one was so we're choosing which instance or which time it shows up in that string. And then it replaces it. I",

And you just want to use a formula really quick, right? And so you can use this in a lot of different ways. So that's how you're able to actually do it with the first instance, the second instance. And if you don't include an instance at all, let's go over to the sum. This is when I think everyone knows how to use. But I'm going to show you two other ones as well. So let's go to the sum. And we're just going to do equals the sum. And I hope you know what this is. Well, not hope. If you don't know what this is, it just adds up all the numbers in range. So we're going to add some means add. So we're going to take this and it's going to give us the what all these salaries are together. So super, super simple. Some is one of probably the most basic formulas that you can do. Some if is a little bit different. You can add an if statement, which we learned right back here. You can add an if statement and then add it if it meets a certain criteria. All right. So we're going to do equals some if and then you're going to need to give a range in criteria and you can include a some range if you would like. So we're going to do the salary again. We're going to do a comma. And now here's our criteria. Let's do if they have greater than 50,000 for their salary and close up parentheses. So now it's only going to add up if their salary is greater than 50,000. Now his is 50,000 exactly. So that won't count. But we have 63 and 65,000, which does equal 128,000. So it just gives a specific criteria or an if statement. Then it does the addition. So super useful. And that one. So that is how you do a sum if and some if is kind of the same thing as we did back here. There's the if and the ifs. So the ifs is going to be if it has it meets multiple conditions. So let's take a look at that one. So let's do equals some ifs. Now now the syntax for this one is going to be a little bit different and you'll see that in just a second. And this adds the cell specified by a given set of conditions or criteria. So let's do no print for open parentheses. We'll give the sum range. So let's do the same one as before. Then we have our criteria range. So what are we looking at? What's this is the area that's going to be added after all these if statements are done. Right. So we have to initially set that. Now we're going to say, okay, what criteria are we basing this off of? So let's put it comma. And we're going to base it off of let's do this one. We'll say if the gender, so we'll do comma, if that's female. If that's female. And then we'll give another one. We can say if they're female and let's say they are greater than greater than 30. We'll close it up. And it's going to give us 88,000. So female, female, there's one, two right here. So it's going to be this one and this one, and that equals 88,000. So that's how that works.

    "text": "tions into the sum formula. So again, I know this one's super simple, but you can use it in a much more complex way if you use the sum if and the sum ifs. Almost the exact same thing for this count. I'm not going to go super in depth into this one. I'll just kind of show you because count is count and sum are kind of on the same level of difficulty. They're both pretty beginner. This is just going to give you a count of how many cells are there. So let's give this range. And so it's not going to add it. It's just going to give us a count. So if we do right here, and scroll over them, like highlight them, this count down here, oops, this count down here is nine. And so it's going to give us that count. But we can do a count with conditions exactly how we did it in the sum. So if we do count if, oops, I did not spell it right. If we do count if we're going to give a range and a criteria exact same as we did before. So let's do this. I mean, you can do this on basically any of these. It doesn't really for this demonstration. It doesn't really matter. But we'll say if their salary is greater than 45,000. So how many people, this is going to give us how many people have a salary over 45,000. And that's five. So before in the sum if if we did that, we did 50,000, it adds everything together. The count is just going to count the amount of cells that meet that criteria. And again, count ifs, we're going to have a criteria range. And then we will specify what if statements we want to be to occur in order to count those cells. So let's do we want, you know, we want to count, it can be any range or it can be any of these. We'll do the ID this time. And now we can say, you know, we want it to be as our criteria one. We can say we want it to be greater than what their ID to be greater than 105. And let's say we want them to be male. So they have an ID over a certain, a certain range. And then they are a male. So there's only three people that meet that criteria. And so it'll be Michael, Stanley and Kevin. Those are our three people. And so it gives us a count very useful to give quick numbers like this. Something I genuinely use a lot. And I don't have said that a lot during this tutorial. But that's because everything I'm showing you are things that I've used a lot. So I don't feel like, you know, I'm speaking out of turn here.

    "text": "t's look at this one. This one is very, has some specific use cases. Notice that this is a text right now. If you do it when it is in a date format, it actually will not work. I mean, I can, you can test it out yourself. You just gotta trust me. It's not going to work. So what this does is this is going to give you the range from this date to this day. That's what it's going to do. So let's do days. It's going to, we want to choose our end date. So this is our end date. That's kind of backward from what you think. End date, just start date, you think start date, date, so you have to start with this one. And then we're going to choose the start date. And now it's going to tell us how many days was it from here to here. And this one is 5,056. So network days is extremely similar except it takes out holidays and it takes out weekends. And you can see how many working days has this person, how many working days or network days as this person worked, not including weekends and holidays, how they actually worked since their start date and their end date. So let's do network days. And I mean, they are start date or end date. And you can specify extra holidays if you'd like, but there are already standards set holidays in there that it takes out. So, you know, if you want to do that, you can. So we're going to do the start date. Again, this one's different. This one says start date and date. And then we're going to give the end date. And if you notice, they are going to be different numbers, dramatically lower because it's taking out weekends and holidays. So this is how many days calendar days they've worked. And this is how many days they've actually been in the office and worked. And that is it. Again, there are so many formulas. I mean, literally hundreds of formulas that you can utilize and use and are out there for you to try out yourself. If there are specific ones that I did not cover in this video, please put it in the comments below so that I can, you know, show you how to do these things. I will say I probably used a majority of the ones that you're going to put in the comments already. And if I haven't used it, I'll take a look at it and see if it's really useful. And I'll show you that. So thank you guys so much for watching. I hope that this has been helpful. I feel like a lot of these things are not things that I learned before I started. Almost all these are ones that I learned while I was on the job. And so I'm hoping that you can get ahead of the curve and you can learn these things before you actually start. So that when you get in there, you're just like killing it with the formulas and people are like, well, this guy is like this guy knows what he's doing and Excel. Give him all the Excel work. And then you become like, you know, just the Excel guy. But everyone, you know, loves you for it. So with that being said, thank you so much for watching. I really do hope this helped.

Now if you don't already know what X lookup is, it is a new feature in Excel to kind of replace the lookup or to be a much better option, at least in my mind as a much better option than the lookup. And so if you're someone who's either used to be lookup a lot and you're trying to you know learn this new option or if you've never used it before, this video will be super helpful. I'll walk you through kind of the options and what X lookup can do as well as the different screen X lookup and be lookup. But before we get into the tutorial, I want to give a huge shout to today's sponsor and that is you to me. You to me is the go to place if you want a full fledged course in Excel.

Now without further ado, let's go on my screen and start the tutorial. All right, so let's get me off the screen because we all know why we're here. So I didn't include this in the formulas video last week because I knew this was going to be a large one and a lot of people are going to want to know how to do this with the different screen V lookup and X lookup is. So it has its own dedicated video to it. So let's get started. It is a formula. So we're going to come in here in the cell. We're going to hit equal and then we're going to start typing X lookup. Now I'm going to hit tab in just a second, but let's read what this says. It says, searches a range on array for a match and returns the corresponding item from a second range or array by default. The exact match is used. So really useful to know. We'll talk a little bit more about that in just a second. Let's hit tab and it's going to complete it. And it's going to start giving us or it's going to tell us what our input values need to be. We're going to have our lookup value. We're going to have our lookup array, our return array, and then some optional things like if not found. So if your option isn't found, what will be the output that it gives us, a match mode and a search mode. And I'm going to show you how to use every single one of these things. As you can see at the very bottom, I've already set up all of the instructional content for this video. And so we'll kind of get through all these different scenarios. So let's just start really quickly with how to use it very simply with the lookup, look up array and return array. So we're going to come in here and we're going to give it our lookup value. Now Toby Flenderson right over here in a three is going to be our lookup value. So that's who we're going to be searching for. Now we're hit comma and now we're going to be needing to look up or to input our lookup array. Now in array is just a range basically. So we're going to do this is where it's going to be searching for that value. This is where it searches for a three. So here's Toby Flenderson. Here's Toby Flenderson. So it will find it in this array right here. Then we're going to hit comma. And now we need to give it the return array. What it's going to return on that row when it finds it. So we're going to return his email. Keep it really simple. So what it should do, and let's close your parentheses, what it should do is it should take Toby Flenderson. It's going to search in this column or in this array. And then it's going to return the email when it finds Toby Flenderson. So it's on Toby Flenderson is on row six. So it's going to find Toby Flenderson. It's going to come over here and it's going to return Toby Flenderson at dendermyflendacorporate.com. That's what it should do. Let's see what it actually does. It's an enter and it r",

    "text": "eturns it. Now if we drag it down like this, it'll apply it to all of these names right here. And it works exactly how it's supposed to. Again, if you have never used the lookup, you don't know how good you have it. Okay, if you look up, it's extremely useful, but just a bit complicated. And I'll talk about that near the end of the video when we compare the lookup to x lookup. But just know that if you're using x lookup for the first time you're just getting into using Excel, you guys have it good. Okay, so just know that. Now let's go over here to x lookup multiple rows because you can return more than one output with x lookup. So let's go right in here and we're going to basically write the exact same thing as we did before. So let's write x lookup. We're going to do Toby Flenderson as our value. We're going to search here and we're going to do something a little bit different this time. We want to include our end date and the email. So what we're going to do is we're going to start here. We're going to go down all the way to the bottom of end date and then we're also going to include the email. And when we do that, it will in the output give us a row or a column for end date and a column for email. So an output for both. So let's hit enter. And now we can see that we have the end date here and the email here. Now one of the downsides or something that I'm not a huge fan of is well, first off, I love that you can do this. That's fantastic. But it has to be right next to each other. So you're only going to get that output exactly how it is in the columns. So if I went and did this range, I would include all of that. So let's just for example, let's pull that down here. So let's take this and put it right here. If I did instead of zero or or O2 to P10, if I included age to email this whole range and I hit enter, it's all going to be included. So you know, tha",

    "text": "t's one of the small downsides of that functionality when you can use multiple rows is that it's going to use the rows exactly as they are. You can't really customize it within the formula. You can move around these columns to how you want it. So that is something to note. And again, you can pull this down and it'll be applied to all of those names. Let's go over to xlookup exact match. So let's open this up. We're going to do equals xlookup as we've been doing. And we're actually going to be looking at the if not found and the match mode both on this tab right here. So let's do what we've been doing before. We take our value that we're looking up. We take the array that we're looking and we're going to do the email. And as you can see, this says to be flender not to be flender. So what we are going to do is we're going to hit comma. And if it's not found, you can return a value or a string that you want to return. Now for simple purposes or for simple instructional purposes, we're going to do not found. And I'm going to close that off. So let's do this. And Toby Flenderson was not found. And so it was returned not found. If Toby Flender was actually in this full name, then it would have returned the email. And then if along the way, one of these was not part of it, then we would have we would have had the not found. All right, so let's go right up here. We're actually just going to copy this because I want to reuse it. And then we're going to go right here and hit a comma. Now this is our match mode option. And so we have four different options that we can choose from. A zero is an exact match and that is by default, that is what we have or what we use. Then there's a minus one. That's an exact match or next smaller item. Then there's a one, which is an exact match or next larger item. And then there's a two, which is a wild card character match. Now we're going to do that. And we are going to try this out and it's not going to work. And not just because I forgot to put a four. It's doing it because it's searching for you easily. But if there's not a wild card option already put in here, it doesn't recognize it. So we need to indicate where that wild card needs to be. So we're going to do a double apostrophe or quotation marks. We're going to put an asterisk right here and then do another one. And we're going to hit an ampersand. So we're going to have an ampersand right here. And what that's going to say is anything that comes before a four, anything that comes before easily is okay. It doesn't matter what it is as long as it has beasley at the end. That is going to be okay. So we're going to have Pam that comes before beasley. And that's going to tell it and it's going to say, okay, I know that anything that comes before beasley is all right. And so when we hit enter is now going to return the output that we are looking for. And we can include that on these as well. Now this one is Meredith. And so Meredith is at the beginning. So we ha",

And the exact same thing for Kevin Malone right here. Kevin Malone. So it just didn't include the N E at the end. And so it's still going to work if we include that asterix at the end. Now I know I said we were looking at search order, but I'm actually going to kind of give you an exact match first and then search order. But it's just kind of easier to show it over here. So I'm going to do X look up. I'm going to look up this value. Do a comma. Here's the range. This is our start date that's going to be looking for. And I want to return the full name. Now no value in here has 112000. But what we can do is we can do comma and then a comma for the match mode and do an exact match or next larger. And I know this is an exact match part, but it kind of refers to search order in a little bit where it searches for the next largest value. That's what that number one represents. The next larger value. So we have 112000. And if we look right here, the next value above 112000 is 152000. And so it should return Angela Martin. Let's see if that works. And there it is. Now let's look up the actual search order. So let's do equals X look up. This is the value that we want to be searching for. And we're going to be looking in this start date and comma. And we want to return the name. Now let's get over to search mode. Now the search mode performs a search starting at the first item. So at the very top going down. So by default, it searches from first to last, but you can reverse that and do search from last to first. We're going to do a binary search, which is where it sorts in a sending order or sorts in descending order. And that's with the actual value. And so we won't be able to show this binary search or on ascending or descending because our values are the same. But if we had different values and we were looking up using this next largest, we would be able to show that. But I'm going to show you the search from first to last and last to first. So let's put in by default. And this is what it would be search from first to last with the default would be. So it starts at the very top. It goes down and finds the first five six two thousand one and returns Toby Flundersen. Now if we go in here and we hit minus one, that is going to search from last to first. So it's going to start at the bottom and go to the top. And the first one that it finds is Michael Scott.",

And you can include that in this binary search in this one as well. All right. Now let's head over to the x look up horizontal. I think we're going to have a few left. Yeah, x look up horizontal. Then we'll do x look up with some. And then I'm going to show you the V look up at the end. So let's go right here. Let's say equals x look the value that we want to be searching for is February.

And now we're going to be searching for paper. Let's do paper. And we'll hit enter. And it found February and then return paper right here. And we can do that for paper printer and manila folders. And so it's going to give us 310, the 40 and the 118 from February. Now let's go right over here to x look up with some. I actually, it's basically a carbon copy of this. Let's take this over here real quick. And place it right there because it's the exact same thing except at the end, we're going to use, I'm going to show you how to use some with the x look up at the same time.

So we're going to go to I1 and then we're going to search this again. And we want whatever value. Oops, goes into that. So let's close that parentheses.

    "text": "different formulas. If you're searching for a specific value and a specific value in another cell, you can add those together using x look up, which is honestly, it's pretty great. So let's go over to the look up. So I wanted to show you this because I wanted to show you where it came from and what we used to do, unless you are continuing to use V look up and what we can do now. So x look up, I just showed you kind of everything. But super cool. I'm going to show you how V look up used to work in a super short way so that you can understand how it used to be used and how it is used. How x look up is used now. So let's go in here. I'm going to say equals and we're going to do a V look up. And so we have a look up value. And so we're going to click this and hit comma, just like we did before. And now we're going to do a table array. And the table array is a little different in that you're searching an entire area. So let's do h2 all the way through O, oops, O 10. So that's what that's what our table array is going to be. Then we're going to do a comma. And now we have to do a column index number, which number are we going to be searching for, which value are we going to be searching for in here. And so we want to search for eight. This is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. We want to return that email. And we're searching for the name right here in this very first column. So we have that comma and we're going to do eight. And then in the range look up, you can do true, which is an approximate match or false, which is an exact match. And we'll do false. I don't know why it's not auto doing it. But there we go. And now we will do it. And it's going to return it just as we had it. A lot of people, I guess not everybody, but some people didn't like and the reason why they created x look up. You had to do those ranges. And if you ever win in here, and then we let's say we added another column, which happens to data. Now it gives us completely different, different data. So let's say for whatever reason, we added address. So now we have these people address. Well, now it's going to give us a different value. It's going to have this end date. Because if we go in here, now it doesn't, now the eighth is this end date. And the ninth is this email. So if you have a V look up that you use for a calculation or a table that you've created or different things in Excel, you then have to go through here and manually change this. And so a lot of people didn't like that. Because if you needed to change data, you needed to change something or add an additional column, you have to go back and fix all of your V lookups. They wouldn't just automatically move with it, which is what happens with x look up. And just to prove this, let's go back to the very first one, which is the x look up. And right now the email is looking at O2 and through O10. We're just going to insert right here. And that would be our new column. We'll do address address. And notice that hasn't changed. And why is that? Because it auto changed for us from P2 to P10, understanding that it wanted to stick with when something was inserted here, wanted to stick with the original data or the original array that was selected. And so x look up does that work for you. And it makes it a little bit easier to automate things and create these processes in Excel without having to go fix it later, which you had to do with V look up. So that is it for today. I hope that you know how to use x look up a little bit better now that you have watched this. If you enjoyed this video, be sure to like and subscribe below. And I will see you in the next video.",

Conditional formatting is basically just a way to see patterns and trends in data and that's a super simple way of putting it. But it's very easy to use and so hopefully I can show you how to use it really easily and a lot of the things that I use the most and some of the things that I use it for so that you can also know how to use conditional formatting. Now before we jump into the tutorial I want to give a huge shout to the sponsor of this Excel series and that is you to me. You guys know by now that I absolutely love you to me. I've been using them for years and I've taken literally hundreds of courses on utemy and I've learned so so much especially when I was first starting out as a data analyst. I learned a lot through their Excel courses on utemy and so I have actually put the ones that I really like and I have taken and enjoyed and think you would as well in the description. So if you want to take those be sure to check those out again huge shout to utemy for sponsoring the series. Now without further ado let's jump onto my screen and get started with this tutorial. All right so let's jump right into it on this home tab right here if we go all over to the right there is conditional formatting and the description that it gives us is easily spot trends and patterns in your data using bars, colors and icons to visually highlight important values and that is exactly how I would have defined it really good job Microsoft exactly how I would have done it. So what you'll see right away is there's nothing too complex so we have some highlights of rules. We have some top bottom rules, data bars, color scales, icons sets and at the bottom we can create a rule. We can clear the rule and we can manage our rules so if you create a rule then you can manage it. So we're going to start with these icons sets and I'm going to show you how to use those and work our way to the top and then I'll show you how to create some rules yourself and how that all works. So let's start off with the icons sets I'm going to go over here to sales and for this data we kind of have this trend or pattern that you can kind of see over time. So over the months so if we go right here and let's use that conditional forming let's use that icons sets and right here we can use these directional so you know we have this kind of time series of each month that shows us how much paper they're selling. And if we do this right here it's going to show us if it's kind of average or if it's below average or if it's above average or if it's going up. So in a really quick glance you can kind of see the pattern of this data set it's kind of going mostly yellow and red. It's only two months what's going up significantly. Now we don't have to only do that for one row or one column you can apply to all of them but as you can see. All these are red now why are they all red it's because they're using numbers for everything so they're comparing these 24's and these 50's and 65's against these 450's and 750's and so they're all going to be red. But if we do it individually if we do it each row if we take it just like this and then we go to icon sets and do it. It's going to be much more representative of the actual printers not of all the numbers as a whole. And you can do other things the arrows are ones that you'll probably see the most often that's the one I've used if I ever do use them. But you can you know do ones like this where they have you know kind of a trend upward or a trend downward. And so there's just several more arrows this one only gives you three as you can see this one gives you five. And you can do you know colors or shapes or different indicators and all these different things. And honestly it's kind of whatever you want to use whatever makes sense for your data but you know I've really only ever seen like these colors being used. I've never really seen these flags or anything like that. But again it just depends on what industry you work in you might you might see that. Let's go right over here to the demographics and let's look at our color scales. Now color scales are going to be the probably the most obvious thing that in data bars are going to be the most obvious things in here. If you go right here and and you look at this color scale. If it's high if it's among the top ones it's green the lowest it's red and you can change that to really any colors you want any colors that they offer you. And it it does exactly what it does. It's a color scale a gradient of the colors from high to low or low to high. And so any color that you do you'll be able to kind",

It's a color scale a gradient of the colors from high to low or low to high. And so any color that you do you'll be able to kind of see you know what's good and what's not good. That really is color scales in a nutshell. Data bars are again super super straightforward. It's going to be either a gradient fill or a solid fill. So let's look at the gradient fill. If we do a blue gradient fill actually let's get rid of our. Let's go over here let's go to clear rules from select it cells. If you haven't looked at that yet but that's how you clear it. Let's go to data bars and we'll use this blue gradient. So with this blue gradient you know this one is or sorry this one is the highest one so it's going to be completely filled. And this one is 36,000 almost half of this pretty close and so it's almost half this one again you know it's not used very often. I you don't see these a lot to be honest you just don't. But if you do see it that's how you use it that's how it can be done. Again pretty easy. As I just showed a second ago if you want to clear the rules you can clear from the selected cells. That's what we're doing so I have column G selected and I'm going to I'm going to clear that. If you want to clear the rules the entire sheet you can do that as well. So it would affect every single column and row. We'll just do this for now. So now let's go look at the top bottom rules. So this is the top 10 items, top 10 percent, bottom 10 items, bottom 10 percent above average and below average. And they're going to do exactly what you think they are going to do. If you select above average it is going to select or highlight the cells that are above the average in column G. So let's look at the salaries that are above average. All right. And so the ones that are at the very top are Michael Scots, Toby Flenderson's and Dwight Shrut. No shock there. I believe the average is somewhere around like 48,500 or something. So I think this one just is just below it. And so all these other ones are below average. And that's just because you know Michael Scots and Dwight Shrut and Toby are kind of bringing up that average quite a bit. So everyone else is going to fall beneath that. So at a super quick glance you're able to just highlight the cells and you're able to see who is above average. And you know you can do this in a lot of different ways in Excel. But this is just a really simple fast way to do that. Let's get rid of that real quick. And let's go back up here. And now we can, oops, let's go to top bottom rules. And now we can see the below average. And it's going to highlight all the other ones. And so it works exactly how you think it is going to work. And this is the default way that it highlights these cells. So it highlights them. This kind of see through red and then it highlights the actual text or the characters in their red as well. Now I'm not going to go through and show you every single one of these top bottom rules. I think they're pretty self explanatory. I just kind of wanted to show you what happens when you do use them. It's going to highlight that cell. So let's go up here to the highlight cells rules. And honestly, these are the ones that I use by far the most. All these other ones combined, I do not use more than this highlight cells rules. And the one in here that I use more than any other conditional formatting rule is this duplicate values. So I'll start with that really quick. And I'll kind of show you a few of these other ones. But this duplicate values to me is one of the most useful ones. And so let's kind of show you how that works. If you go to the start date, you can see that we have a duplicate value right here. And if we go over here, the conditional formatting, highlight cells rules, and duplicate values, it's going to highlight the duplicate. And that says duplicate right here. Now we can go through here and click on unique. And then it would highlight all the ones that are not duplicates. So you can use it kind of in a similar inverse way. It's just different, different. But I use the duplicate almost always. Ano",

Now we can go through here and click on unique. And then it would highlight all the ones that are not duplicates. So you can use it kind of in a similar inverse way. It's just different, different. But I use the duplicate almost always. Another thing that you can do is go over here and you can change the color or you can even do a custom, which I just never do that. It's not something I spend a lot of time doing. I typically just stick with this one. So you can do that. And it's going to highlight something that has a duplicate value in there. Now, why do I use this so much? I work with a lot of different types of data sets. But one thing that you'll find in almost all of them is they have some type of ID. And they're going to have some type of personal information, whether that's a Social Security number or an address or a cell phone number or something like that. There is going to be data that is going to identify that person. Now, I work a lot with pharmaceutical data, a lot with pharmacy data, as well as healthcare data. So like names, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, all those things, all that customer or client information. And oftentimes when I get a new data set and I have it in Excel or I convert it to Excel, I will start using these duplicates to try to find issues with the data. And I find them all the time. Either there's an employee ID or some type of customer ID or client ID that has a duplicate in there that should not be in there or there's multiple Social Security numbers or there's an issue in some other way. And I'm able to find those things and spot those patterns using this duplicates. And I promise you, I use this one almost every single time I open a new data set or I work with the new clients working with their data. And so I wanted to show you this one. I wanted to really press upon you that this one is a really, really, really good one to know and learn how to use. It's not complicated. It's not hard. It just shows you, you know, if there's a duplicate value. But I wanted you to know how I use it and how often I use it so that you can pick that up and put that in your toolkit and your back pocket so that you can use that later on if you have a similar need or if you're trying to do something similar to what I was just talking about. So that is how duplicates work. Again, super great. It's obviously not super useful when you're only using 10 rows. But when you have, you know, 50,000, 100,000 and there should be zero duplicates in there and you highlight it and then you come right here, use the filter. And we're going to filter and we're going to sort by the color and it allows you to sort by the color and you have duplicates in there then that's a problem. And you identify the problem super quickly. And, you know, some of those things they slip by because nobody checks it. And so that's something that I often check. And if you go here and you sort by color and there isn't an option to do this, this pink red color, and that means there aren't any duplicates and that's a really good thing. Most of the time that's a really good thing. So let's go ahead and we're going to clear that as well as get rid of our conditional formatting rules. Now another one that I use a lot is this one right here which is the text that contains. Honestly, this one comes a lot in handy, especially when you're looking for like a specific keyword. In my case a lot of times I was using this when I was going through drug names. I am not a doctor. I do not pretend to be a doctor. And so when I was looking for lorazza, Pam or something like that, I would just search for like lorazza or something and not lorazza. But lorazza, you know, I would just search for it and then all the ones that contain that will pop up. I can bring them to the top and I can see them. And to me, that's super, super useful. And I would do that all the time. And so in this case, we're looking at emails. And let's say we all only wanted to pull all the ones that are gmail. And so now we can go through and we can, you know, click OK and that's going to pop up. Or we want all the ones that have dunder, dunder mithlin. And if we click on that, all the ones that",

And if we click on that, all the ones that are dunder mithlin come up or have dunder mithlin in it and again, we can sort by or we can and so we can sort by right here and we can bring all those to the top. And so super, super useful. And another use for it that you may not think of is something like if it's, you know, there's some incorrect data in there. This happens often with phone numbers, addresses, start dates or dates in general, date formats where you can go in here. And you can say text that contains and if you know you put in a dash and it has it in there, then you know that that is wrong. Now that is really all I wanted to show you in the highlight cells rules. The duplicate values and the text contains are by far the ones that I use the most. All the other ones I have used, these ones not so much. But in these highlight cells rules, I use these two all the time. Sometimes I use this between. I don't really use these other ones as much although I have used them. And so if you got nothing else from this video, I just wanted you to know that these two are super useful. And if you haven't used them before to maybe try them out and see you can apply them to your own data sets. Now, we've looked at all of these presets, ones in conditional formatting. But you can also do a new rule. And so if we click on new rule right here and we go down to use a formula to determine which cells to format, we can add our own formula in here that will then highlight exactly what we want. And so if there isn't a preset rule that you like and it doesn't have the option that you want, you can do almost any formula that you want in our formulas video that we did a few weeks ago. And you can put it in here and then you can format what you want the cell to look like if it meets that criteria. So let's take this right over here. And before we start this formula, I just want you to note that I have H 11 highlighted. That's going to come into play in just a little bit. But I want you to be aware that H 11 is the cell that we're highlighted. So what we're going to do is we are going to create our formula. Now, if you've never created a formula, I highly recommend watching my formulas tutorial because that is going to show you how to do this. But all we're going to do is we're going to do Eagles. That's how you start the how you actually create a formula. And we're going to give it this range right here. And so it's going to take everything from G2 to G10. Now, these dollar signs are super important. If you don't know how to use them or you don't know what they do, you're going to mess up this formula a lot. And so what this dollar sign basically does is it's basically hard coding it in there. It is only going to look at G2 and it's only going to look at G10 or through G10 because that colon. And this can come into play because if you have something selected like the H 11, it's going to mess it up because now if you have H 11 selected like we do, you'll see this in a second. It's not going to be applied to this. And again, I'll show you that in just a minute. But we don't want this hard coded in there. Okay, but we do have to select the proper range in a second. So we're going to get rid of this. We're going to get rid of the dollar signs because we want it to be pretty fluid and be able to apply to be applied basically anywhere we want. Let's go into this formula. If it meets our criteria, let's give it a border and we'll give it some color. We're going to say if this is greater than 50,000. So let's hit okay and nothing happened. So let's go back and see why. So if we go to our managed rules, you can see that as well as the G2 to G10 is greater than 50,000, but it only is being applied to this H 11 cell, which really makes no sense. So if we had wanted to get it done the first time we needed to have basically selected that G2 to G10 right away, but we can do that now. So let's get rid of this. And we're going to say G2 to G10. And that is hard coded in there. That",

And that is hard coded in there. That should be fine still, but let's see what it does. And so now every single thing is highlighted and why is that? That's because when we changed it, it also changed the format of it because we changed the cell that we were looking at. So we need to come back here and that's why again you want to do this the right way of first time. We're going to come back here. We're going to give it this range. And we're going to get rid of these dollar signs. And now we're going to hit okay. And so now it's being applied G2 to G10. And G2 to G10 will keep it like that. And we'll apply it. And now it works properly. So now everything that's above 50,000 is being highlighted. Again, if that was confusing, it is confusing. It genuinely is. And so if you wanted to do this right, the first time without having to make a bunch of changes, you'd want to highlight these before you start. And then you want to go in and create the rule. We'll do this really quick just to kind of show you what I'm talking about. We'll say equals. We'll give it this range. Give rid of these real quick. Because again, I don't want this hard cut it in there. It will ruin our formula. And then we'll say greater than 30. And we'll give this nice green. And so now if they're over the age of 30, it will be highlighted. And we didn't have to go back and change anything. We didn't have to go back and fix anything like we did in the first one. That was all for demonstration purposes. But again, you need to really be aware of that. That is something that I think almost everybody is going to mess up at some point. If you don't already know about it, then you definitely are going to make that mistake. Now, if we come over here in this area, we go to our Manage Rules. And not just the current selection, but this whole worksheet. Then you can see that we have these two formulas. Now you can go in and edit any of these by double clicking or clicking on it and then hitting edit rule. You can also delete these rules or duplicate these rules. I just wanted to show you what you're able to do with them. But if we go ahead and we get rid of this, so let's say we delete that rule and we hit apply, you know, the rules going to go away. That's that, I mean, it's as simple as that. So that is how you can create your own rule. I want to be again, very specific in the fact that that is a confusing piece. And if you mess that up, you're going to be, you know, fixing a bunch of different stuff and not understanding why your rule is not working properly. It's just because it's confusing. Those dollar signs are really important to watch out for. And that is all there is to it with conditional formatting. Again, conditional formatting is, you know, it's not anything super confusing. We've looked at more complicated things, but it's a really, really useful tool to use. So look at these patterns and trends super quickly and to find these outliers or these specific values that you're looking for very quickly. And if you're looking at just thousands and tens of thousands or hundreds of thousands of rows, this is one of the fastest ways to find these things without having to kind of wait and filter and use these. These filters right here, because again, this can just take forever. And so if you haven't or if you've never worked with a ton of data and try to use this before, it can take honestly like 10 minutes for something simple that you can do with conditional formatting in like 10 seconds. So definitely something to mess with and use when you are working with your own data sets. I hope this was helpful. I mean, honestly, I use this all the time. So, you know, I hope that somebody out there can can use this for their own work that they're currently using. Thank you guys so much for watching. I really appreciate it.

    "text": "What's going on everybody? Welcome back to another Excel tutorial. Today we will be looking at charts. Now if you have data in Excel and you want to visually show that with bars or graphs or anything like that, you can do that really simply and I'm going to show you how to do that today and a lot of people are a little bit intimidated because they think it's a little bit complicated but I promise to you by the end of this video you will know how to do it like a pro. It's not that difficult. It's just you need to know where to look, where to click and how to actually filter through things to make sure that you're visually showing the things that you want to show. But before we actually jump into the tutorial, I want to give a huge shout to the sponsor of this Excel series and that is you to me. You may not know this but I probably get at least 15 to 50 companies every single month reaching out to me wanting to sponsor the channel and promote their product and I turn down almost every single one because I either don't know their product or I don't believe in their product and so I'm not going to go and promote that on my channel. But you know me is one that I have consistently promoted over the past year and that's because I truly believe in their product. I've been taking courses off their platform for years and I've honestly learned so much and I cannot recommend them enough. So if you want to take a full-fledged Excel course, I have my recommendations in the description if you want to check those out. Thank you again to you to me for sponsoring this Excel series. So without further ado, let's jump on my screen and get started with this tutorial. All right, so let's jump right into it. Right here we have the Dunder Mifflin Sales Report and over here we have all the products that they were selling along with the months that they were sold in and so in January they sold 450 reams of paper. Down here we have the total items per month and so in January they sold 898 units of products or things that they sold. At the very end we have the year end total so this is the total amount of paper that they sold throughout the year. Now we're going to use this data right here for all of our charts. Now you may not have data exactly like this. It can come in lots of different flavors but you're going to get the basic gist of how to use charts, how to edit it, how to customize it, to fit what you need and then we're going to kind of put it right over here and kind of create its own sheet where we can kind of visualize all the things that we want to show. So let's jump right back over here into sales and first thing we need to do is kind of highlight the data that we're going to be working with. Now I'm going to start with everything but you know I'll show you along the way we don't actually want everything but we can filter that stuff out as we go. So let's go right here and we're going to insert and we're going to go over to charts. Now this is the charts section. There's lots of different types of charts but the first thing that we're going to be looking at is right here is a 2D column or kind of like a bar chart. Now we're just going to click right here and we're going to pull this down. So now that we have this down here there are a few things that I want to show you before we actually really get into it and I kind of want to show you the options that you have. So if you go up here we have different chart styles and so if I hover over them you can see that each one kind of looks a little bit different and it really doesn't matter. It doesn't really change the data in any way just how you visualize it and so if that is important if that is something that you you want to stick with a certain theme or a certain look then go for that. The other thing that's really nice to have over here is this switch row and column. So right down here you can see this purple and you can see this red. Those are our rows and columns and we can switch that right here. So if we go like this now instead of the months being right here the months are the colors and the actual product is right here. Let's click it again and it'll go back and so now we have this kind of time series. Now we have the January through the end of your total. Now this one is one that I think is super helpful. You know you can do it down here as well if you go to this filter. But both of these are super helpful because you sometimes just want to select all the data and then kind of get in there and mess with it. Something that we want to get rid of is this total items per month. So we want to remove that and then we also want to remove this year end total because both of those are are kind of the end result. They're not the actual data per month or per product. So we're going to get rid of those and we're going to apply that. And as you",

They're not the actual data per month or per product. So we're going to get rid of those and we're going to apply that. And as you can see just right off the bat our data is changed dramatically and that's because we aren't including these these large large numbers that were kind of throwing off the visualization for us. So this one right here as is is already pretty good. What we can do right here is we can change this and we're just going to say products sold per month. Now what we can do if we want to move it to another to another sheet is we can actually move the chart and we can select where we want to move it. We can move it to chart sheet and we can do that or something that I do almost 99% of the time is I just copy and it come over here and I'm going to paste it. And so now we have this chart right over here as well as back here. And so I typically tend to do that because now we can still go over here and change this one as much as we want. So if we want to go in here we can alter this one and it won't affect the other one. So we just have basically two copies. So we're going to keep this one right here. This is going to be our first visualization. And as I said it's it's fairly straightforward. If you've ever done any types of charts or graphs before right here it's January, February, March, April, May. And if you hover over these you can see that that's the paper and if we just glance you know the paper is their biggest product by far. And so that blue which is their paper is going to be the biggest every single month. So that makes perfect sense. Now what if we want to change up the kind. So what if we want to change up the kind of visualization that it offers us? We have a lot of different options. Let's go right over here to change chart type. Now this is going to offer you just about everything you could possibly imagine or want and even things that you absolutely would never ever want ever. And so I'm going to show you some of the good ones and I'm going to show you some just absolutely insane ones that Excel came up with which can I I could not imagine a scenario that these are ever used. But within these columns you can do they're called cluster columns, these stacked columns. So it would look just like this. Those are often used as well. And then we have ones that they're just not used often. Let's let's take a look at this one right here. I mean it's tough. It's tough to look at. But let's let's put it right here. This is basically the same thing that we just had except visualized in a different we'll call it more unique way. And let's let's do for the sake of it. Let's put it over here. These two things show the same information. They show the same data. Just one is shown well and one is not shown well. I'm not a fan of these 3D type of visualizations. I just don't like them. But maybe you do. And you want to use that. That's fantastic. Let's go back. Something else that you probably use a lot are things like these these line graphs. Okay. So these are line graphs and they're different types. So they're these stacked 100% stacked line lines with markers. Different flavors for this this type of line graph. And so you can go in here and take a look. Again, not my favorite. But they have it as an option if you choose so choose to do this. But I kind of I'm kind of a simple guy. But I'm going to go in here and it's pretty clustered. I want to kind of take the ones that have the highest sales or the highest total amount sold. So that would be paper, manila folders and three ring binders. So let's go in here. We want to keep paper. We want to keep manila folders. And we want to keep three ring binders. And let's apply that. And so now it's a lot cleaner. And we're just going to copy this and we're going to put it over here. And I'm just putting these all over here for you because we'll look at this at the end and just kind of see different options and ways to do things as we have gone through this tutorial. So let's go back here. Now",

And I'm just putting these all over here for you because we'll look at this at the end and just kind of see different options and ways to do things as we have gone through this tutorial. So let's go back here. Now something else that we haven't looked at is the actual colors and color schemes that you can do. So let's go right here to these chart styles. And we can go to color. Now color is something that probably is quite overlooked in actual charts and graphs. Some terrible colors like this or this where they're really close together, especially when you have a lot of them. For example, let's just pretend we put all of them back really quickly. It is near impossible to distinguish these colors. We wouldn't want that. Let's go back to this color. You know, when you have it like in some of these colors at least, at least distinguishes them. So you can kind of see what you're working with. But when you have it in these monochromatic options, sometimes they're just impossible to distinguish. So be sure to choose the right colors that you're using so that if somebody who's never seen this data before looks at it, they can easily distinguish the product and the month that you are looking at. But let's go just back up here. We'll choose this default option. Let's choose this one right here. This one's nice. Although there's lots of yellows and oranges. I'll see this one. This is not bad. Greens, blues, and like yellows. So that's nice. Other things that we want to look at and there are these chart elements right here. Other things that we can add are things like data labels. And right here, it's super messy. But if we went back and we got rid of some of these things like the printers, the tables, highlighters, pens, and total, we apply that. It's a little bit easier to distinguish. And that's something that you may be interested in doing. You can also add this data table at the bottom, which is the actual columns and rows that you have for this visualization right here. Now, let's expand this quite a bit. I'm going to make this extremely large. If you have something like this, it actually can be pretty nice. You know, maybe we get rid of these data labels. But it can be easy because you're putting it all in place. You can also make this two separate visualizations. You can have one visualization just like this and right underneath it, you can have the actual rows and columns. But this option allows you to put it all in one. So let's put this back down because that is way too big. And let's expand it a little bit. Now, if you notice right here, we have our legend up top. It is possible to actually change that. You can go right here and you can move this kind of wherever you want. But it's not exactly easy to put based off how we have it right here. If we go into this chart elements, we get out to legend and hit this arrow right here. We can select it on the right, the top, the left, and the bottom. Or we can just go to more options, which allows us to push it anywhere. But let's say I want to do it just like this. I'm going to put it on the right and I actually want to bring it down right here. And you know, that's just an option if you want to kind of customize it a little further, makes a little cleaner. You can do that with almost any of these things. So if you click on this, oops, if you click on this, you can move this anywhere as well. So if you want to move this over here on top of it, you can make it look terrible or you can move it right back over here. You know, this is something that you can move around. You just kind of want to make sure you're doing it the right way. So let's get this back where it was. There we go. Now before we go any further, let's copy that and put it right over here with our other charts and graphs. And if you see over here on this side, we have this format chart area. Notice I haven't showed you this at all yet. That is because I genuinely just don't use this almost at all. There are some good stuff in here. And I'm sure that, you know, if you were someone who really wants to go in there and super cus",

And I'm sure that, you know, if you were someone who really wants to go in there and super customize it, you can do that. But I honestly, I just never get in here. I never, you know, change the glow or the shadows. Just not something I use. And some of these are only for these 3D formatting, which I never use. And so I'm not going to show you and walk through these things again. I really don't use it. And so if you want to go in there and mess with it, you know, by all means, go for it. It's just not something that I want to take the time to show you. And with that being said, let's go back over to this chart sheet that we have. And it was super, super easy to get these charts and graphs and whatnot. There are lots of different options. Again, if we go back here and we go here to chart design and go to the change chart type. And again, there are a ton of different options like a pie chart. Like this. It's, you know, you can try to figure this out and use these. But, you know, I wanted to show you the ones that you probably use the most, which are these columns and line charts. And they all kind of are similar in their own way. This bar chart is basically, you know, this column chart just on its side. And so they all have their different flavor. They all have a different way of visualizing the data. But in essence, they're using the data in a similar way to visualize it and represent the data itself, especially things like these box and whisker plots or these waterfall charts. You know, these are things that usually require specific data to kind of use. And so I'm just using data that you'll probably see the most of like this, the sales data. So I hope that this gives you a pretty good, you know, quick understanding of how to use these, how to customize them, how to copy and paste them over to a different sheet to create some type of little chart and visualization sheet that you can use to show your employers and visualize the data that you are working with.

    "text": "What's going on everybody welcome back to the Excel tutorial series today we will be looking at how to clean data in Excel. Now knowing how to clean data in Excel is actually extremely useful and there are a ton of techniques to do this. I'm going to be showing you the ones that I probably use the most and I feel like are the most helpful to kind of do the bulk or the majority of the data clean that you're going to do in Excel. Like I said there's so many different ways and very specific things that you can do but I'm going to highlight some of the bigger ones that I find the most useful. And some of you may be thinking well I'll just do my data cleaning in SQL or Python or when I get it ready to put it in Tableau. But honestly a lot of the data cleaning at least a lot of big stuff I tend to do in Excel if the data set is small enough to fit in Excel. And so I think it's actually really really useful to know how to do this because you'll most likely be doing it more than you think. Now before we jump into the tutorial I want to give a shout out to the sponsor of this video and it's a brand new sponsor it is unlocked by Z by HP. Unlocked is a movie that's actually broken up into four parts and each of them have a unique data science challenge associated with it. Now I'm going to read this next part because it's extremely interesting. Each challenge represents a different topic so there's data visualization, text analysis, audio signal processing and computer vision. And you can submit your answers and your work on their website for a chance to win one of 10 Zbook Studio laptops or a free trip to the Kaggle World Championships. So I'll leave a link in the description where you can go watch the movie and then do the challenges and then submit your answers for a chance to win. You should also go check out their hackathon where you can do these projects with other people just like you who are trying to figure out these answers and submit them to win as well. So go check that out. Thank you again to the sponsor of this video unlocked by Z by HP. Now without further ado let's jump on my screen and get started with the tutorial. All right so let's jump right into it. I have this US president's data set. I got the base data set from Kaggle. But I added some of my own data and then I messed some stuff up as well just to kind of demonstrate some of these things I want to be looking at today. This is not a full project so you know we're actually going to be using this to create new visualizations or anything like that. So you know all this is just for demonstration purposes. But we will be doing a full project in about two or three videos in this Excel series where we're going to be doing from start to finish with a real data set. So you know if that's something that you're you're wanting then we will absolutely be doing that. Now something that you may be wondering is how do you actually identify what you need to clean in the data? What do you know to look for? Well some of the obvious things are things like formatting and standardization. So things like you know this James Monroe is in all caps that happens all the time with real data. And so you know you want to standardize that or this all over case you want to standardize that you want that all to be the same. There's also things like right here where we have this wig and this wig with a bunch of random stuff after it. This happens all the time where it's not completely standardized and you may even notice. You know there are some spelling errors in here and I'll we'll kind of look through that in a little bit. And then you know there are things like additional spaces where there shouldn't be spaces. There are things like currencies that you need to be aware of. If you were importing this into or we're going to be importing this into a SQL database. Things like currencies can be just a problem or be really unnecessary. It may actually cause more issues in the long run. So you may just want to you know take that to the base value. And then dates are always an issue always always always so always look at your dates. Make sure they're they're formatted correctly. Make sure they're all the same. These are the types of things that write when I glance at this data set. These are things that I'm looking for. One other thing that is actually the first thing that we're going to start out with is you want to make sure that your data is not duplicated. Because if your data has duplicate data in it and you don't want that it's not supposed to be there. There are some specific use cases where duplicated data is okay. You know you you want to get rid of that. And it's very easy to do an Excel. The first thing we're going to do we're going to go to this data tab. We're going to go right over here and we're going to get see if there's any duplicates in our data. So we're just going to go up to remove duplicates. It's going to automaticall",

We're going to go right over here and we're going to get see if there's any duplicates in our data. So we're just going to go up to remove duplicates. It's going to automatically choose all of your columns to to chuck against. So it's going to from A all the way through I it's going to see is the exact same data in all these rows. And if it is it's going to get rid of it. And so we're going to click okay. And it did find one duplicate. And I'll show you that one real quick. Because you know it was right here. So Barack Obama was here twice and then I'm going to hit control. I hit control Z day. Go back. I'm going to hit control Y. So go forward. And it removed that that row completely. Now in this example you may be able to spot that with your eye. But in a real data set where you have 10,000, 100,000 rows there's absolutely no way you're going to see that. Or very, very unlikely that you are going to see that there's duplicated data in there. So just running a quick D-Doop or removing of duplicates. That is really important to make sure that you have gotten rid of those things. So that's one of the first things that I do. We're going to go into a lot of these different columns. And I'm going to kind of show you different techniques or things that I do when I look at actual data. So I'm going to come right over here. I'm going to insert. And this is what I actually do. I usually create a separate column, especially when I'm working with this. Because I don't want to change this one. I don't want to go in here and you know say equals upper equals proper, etc. There's a lot of different ways that you can change names or not a lot. The main ones that you can change names and all of them are completely okay. So for example, I'm going to hit equal upper, upper, and I'm going to go like this and close my parentheses. So I selected the sound. I closed my parentheses, enter. And I'm going to hit in the bottom right over to double click this. It's going to apply it to all of them. It is completely okay to have your data like this. If you want it to be like that. If you want it to be all lower, you can do that. If you want it to be in proper case, you can do that. There are different uses for all of them. And honestly, as long as it's all the same, typically it's okay. But if for example, if you're selling this to like a third party company or something like that, they may have what they want for their ingestion process when they take your file in. If you send a weekly file or a monthly file, they may want it exactly how they want it. And you can change that to what they want. But as long as it's standardized for you, it's all the same for you. That is a good thing. So now we have all of these in the proper case. That's typically what I do or I use upper. Those are the ones that use the most. I don't usually use lower. And if you go in here and you type in lower, you know, it changes it to all lower. I don't typically do that. And I'm going to add, I'm going to say president- fixed. And so now all of these names, all of these different upper case and lower case, these are all fixed. And it just makes it so much easier to read and you don't have different upper case and lower case issues. It's all the same. So I'm going to keep that right there. If we move a little bit to the right, if you look at this prior, now this prior is a mess. It has stuff all over. And to be honest, this is not really something that I would probably be using. Like in a real data set, I would look at this column and I'd say this is pretty useless. If I had a very specific use case for this data in this column, I might try to parse it out and do something, but I don't. This is a completely useless column to me. So I'm actually going to skip this one. I'm going to go to this party one. And this party one to me looks pretty important because this is something that I know I can root by and I can create visualizations with and kind of break that out. And if you look right here, we're going to add a filter. So now let's open up party and take a look. So if we look right here, we have Democratic, Democratic, Da",

So if we look right here, we have Democratic, Democratic, Dash Republican, Federalist, Nonpartisan, Republican, Republican's, Wig, and Wig with a date and some information, the back of it in and some blanks. And it's really important when we're looking at these ones that we think we might group by, that we have these properly grouped. So Republican and Republicans to me right off the bat looks like a spelling error. And so I'm just going to deselect all. I'm going to go to Republican Republicans. And it's literally Republican all the way down except for this last one. And to me, that's just something that I would update. So I would just go right here. I do that. If I didn't do that and then I try to create, let's say, a pivot table on here, I'll have its own group of Republicans and it wouldn't be added to Republican. And maybe that's on purpose, but let's just presume that we know this data extremely well, nothing not supposed to be like that. Right? Again, that just comes back to knowing your data really well, understanding what it, you know, what it should look like. And we know that it should not be like that. So we're going to fix that. The next thing that we're going to fix, and as you can see, it got rid of it. Next thing we're going to fix is this wig. That's just like an error. That's that's some issue on the data side. And we're just going to fix that by updating it. And that's it. I would always be keeping a copy of this with the raw data somewhere else. Because this is presumably like a working document. This is not a, you know, you aren't saving over your original file. Let's just say that. And then let's take a look at these blanks real quick. Okay. So there are these rows right here that have nothing. I think we're okay. But if we see anything different, 47, 48. Okay. So yeah, it's just these ones right here that have no data in it. Anyways, it's just seeing it in the filter. So not an issue at all. So okay, we're looking good. We've gone all the way over. We fixed this president. We skipped this one. We cleaned up this party. And I kept this one in here because I'm not exactly sure if that's a democratic or a publican. So I'm going to keep it its own thing. I'm not a huge history buff in that aspect. The next one right here is, the next one right here is really easy. This is something that happens all the time, especially on actually most often it all happens on numerical data. So like, you know, there'll be a number of 1,000 in one. And then there'll be a space after it for absolutely no reason. And it happens all the time. It does happen like this as well, where you'll see this. And all you have to do is do trim and select the cell, close that front C. And we're going to apply that all the way down. What is so fantastic about the trim is that it's really intuitive and it knows basically everything it needs to do. For example, it gets rid of the spaces before. It gets rid of extra spaces in the middle. And it'll get rid of extra spaces at the end, which you wouldn't be able to see. But they are there and they absolutely can cause issues. If you have spaces at the end that you cannot see, let's take this one. For example, like if I had spaces at the end, that can cause issues when you insert or put that into a database. That happens a lot with numbers. You know, when you're putting that into SQL, that can cause issues. And so you really, it is important to actually do that trim. And you can do that on all of your columns or just ones that you know you're having issues with. But once you import that data into SQL, you will know if there's an issue or not when you actually try to start using it. So we're going to say vice. And we're going to say fixed. There we go. This next one is one that you'll run into a lot. When you're working with numerical data, you will encounter so many different issues. One that I run into a lot is I've worked with a lot of cost data or pricing data. And when it's in an Excel, it sometimes comes in with these cu",

This next one is one that you'll run into a lot. When you're working with numerical data, you will encounter so many different issues. One that I run into a lot is I've worked with a lot of cost data or pricing data. And when it's in an Excel, it sometimes comes in with these currencies, like a dollar sign, a pound sign, things like that. And when you put that into SQL, it just is a nuisance. Right? You're not going to be able to run. It's going to go in as a text or it's going to be like a string, right? Because it has that special character. You don't want that. You don't want to have to then go in and then change things around. You just want to be able to start, doing calculations on those numbers. So what you can do is sometimes they'll come in as a text, sometimes it'll come in as a currency, which I think this one's a currency. We are just going to change that to be a number. And then we're going to get rid of these. Oops. And get rid of those. That, it doesn't look as pretty, but that is much more useful than actually having the currency on there with the decimals. This actually is so much easier when you want to use it for almost anything, because you're able to add and do things properly in other systems. And it's not like I think it does understand it, but that can cause issues. So there is how you do that. The next thing that we're going to look at is these dates. And just notoriously, whenever I see a date field, I know there's going to be an issue with it. It's very rare that I get a date field that is perfect. It is genuinely is a novelty when that happens. And most of the time it has to do with, let's say, a date comes into Excel and it's in a text format. Or date comes into Excel and they're not the same. In this example, they are not the same. And we just want them to all be similar. They say date. If you look right here, it says date. It says date. It looks like it should be the same. But if we go like this, it all looks the same. There's no issues at all. If we were to try to use that, it may or may not be an issue. But we don't want to leave that to chance later on if you're using this with Python or something like that. It can cause issues. Maybe not in SQL because it may see the underlying what's in the underlying cell. Not just what we see. But some systems won't. And so you want to make sure that they're all the same. And so what we were doing back here with the party and we were looking at this filter. Identifying the issues. I usually do that on date fields as well. And oftentimes, I'll just for demonstration purposes. Oftentimes, I will get something like that. And then I'll come up here and I'll notice that there's this one random number. That happens all the time. All the time. And so you want to make sure that you look at these things and just do it at least a quick glance. If not kind of doing it kind of a deep dive into it. All we're going to do is we're going to do both of these. And we're going to do a short date. And let's take a look and see if it fixed it. And so now they are all the same format. And that is fantastic. That is exactly what we want. We're going to go back through here. We're going to get rid of these. Again, this is a working. This is a working document. Oops. We need to. I'm going to do control shift down. Oops. Let me go back up. Do control shift down and copy. And what I'm going to do right now is I'm actually going to copy. All right. Let me do it right here. I'll show you. Sometimes I do this. This just depends. I'm going to go right here. I'm going to hit right click. And I'm going to paste as a value. Which means it's not going to take the calculation of the formula that I just did. It's going to actually paste it as that value. So we just replaced it. Right here you can see up here it says equals trim of G2. This now now that I copied and pasted it over as a value. It got rid of that calculation. And now it is actually a string. So we don't need this anymore. And I'll do the same thing over here as well. I'm going to control shift down. Copy. And I just hit the right key. Or the left key. Sorry.

Sorry. Now I'm going to right click and I'm going to do paste as a value. And again, it has this proper. And now it doesn't have the proper. It's actually the value that was here. So it's really important to note. And we're going to get rid of that one. And so now what we have is already looking much better. Now one of the last things that we're looking at is deleting columns that we are not going to use. And this is why it's so important to keep a backup or the raw data not in this file. Because if you start saving over this file and this is your raw file, back in mess up a lot of things. And that happens to me before and it's terrible. And then you have to request another file or you have to go back and find it or something that is terrible. So this is our working document. So we can mess with this and do whatever we want for our purposes. Now for us, I can already tell you that this prior is a bunch of nonsense and we do not need it. We're not going to use it for anything. And if we have, this is a very small data. So it only has like, let's say, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. We have like eight columns that we're kind of using that has data. Eight or nine. Now that's a small data. So I've had ones with literally like hundreds. And it has so many columns, so much data. And sometimes it's good to just trim it back to the things you're going to use. This to me is absolutely useless. We're going to delete that. And then right over here, it's pretty redundant. It's just one number off. But if we scroll down just a little bit, it goes, it's basically just counts. It's a, you could even call it a unique identifier if you want. Sure, why not? But we don't need both. So we're going to get rid of this first one. And now we have more of the useful and relevant data rather than the stuff that we absolutely know that we are not going to use. These date updates and date created, we may never use them. But we might. So it doesn't hurt to keep it on hand. Those other ones are ones that we are almost certain we will never use. Again, keep it back up. Just in case you need it, you can always go back and get it. So, you know, if you go back to what we started with and you look at what we have now, it is much cleaner. It's much more usable. And these are small subtle changes, especially with this very small data set of only like 50 rows or 46 rows. But you're going to be working with data sets that are thousands, tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands of rows. And you need to know how to kind of look at this data, standardize it, format it properly, for what you're going to be using it for. If you're keeping it in Excel, there are different things that you may do than if you're putting into a database or going to be using it with, you know, using Python to access it. So you need to kind of know your use case. But these are some things that I do all the time to kind of clean up the data before I use it for something, whether I'm creating pivot tables or I'm inserting it into, or I'm putting it into SQL. These are things I do all the time. And so hopefully that helps give you kind of an idea of some of the things that you should be looking for when you're actually cleaning data. And it's really important to understand why you're actually making these changes. And the reason you're making these changes, because some of the things that I did today may not be things you want to do on a different data set that has different uses and different purposes for. So, you know, take everything that I've said and apply it with a little grain of salt to your data set, because your specific needs may be different than when I wanted when I was cleaning my data set. So I hope this was helpful. I hope this gave you a small glimpse of some of the things that I'm looking for when I clean a data set or I get a new data set in and I'm kind of, you know, analyzing it, figuring out what I need to fix in it.

    "text": "What's going on everybody welcome back to another video today we are starting our Tableau tutorial series. Now this series is for absolute beginners so if you have never used Tableau before you were in the perfect place I'm gonna take you all the way from the very beginning of installing it and just understanding what Tableau is and how you can use it all the way to creating dashboards and sharing it. Now personally I hate those videos that are like three hours long and they just expect you to go through it I'd like to break my videos up in the chunks so if you have ever done my sequel tutorials you'll know that I like to break things up so it gives you time to try them out and do them yourself and then you can move on to the next video so I'm going to be breaking this up into five separate videos but in this video I'm going to show you how to install Tableau for free. I'm going to show you these are interface we're going to download a data set that you can find on Kaggle and then we will build our first visualization together with that being said let's jump over my screen and we'll get started. Alright so the very first thing that we need to do is you need to actually download Tableau so we're not going to be using Tableau we're going to be using a free version called Tableau Public it has a lot of the same features except of course it's not every single feature that regular Tableau has but it is absolutely perfect for learning it and for using it and you can even build you know dashboards and share those for your portfolio. I'm going to put this link in the description so you can just go and click on that and all you have to do is input your email right here and click download the app and then it should start to download and then you can save that and then you're going to open this up. Now I'm going to open it up I don't know what it's going to do I already have it downloaded but it should open up and look hopefully like what you're seeing on my screen in just a second let's see what it does. I hope you can see this but it says Tableau Public it says I already have it set up but you're going to click install and go through all that all that setup stuff so I'm going to exit out of here but I'm going to go over here and type in Tableau Public it's 2021.3 that's the current version that they have out if you're doing this in the future they may have you know different versions so you should be able to pull this up right here now I'm going to go and get our data set that we're going to be using and I'm going to show you how to get that as well and then we will actually jump into Tableau and start using it. So let's go over here I'm going to get a data set from Kaggle I wanted something pretty generic to show you in future videos I'm going to show you some special or not special but just different visualizations that you might use and we'll get different data sets for those because of course not one data set covers all these other types of visualizations so we're starting up pretty simple right here we're going to be getting one called video game sales and we can take a really quick look at it here are some of the fields that you're going to be having like rank name platform the year genre and then some sales data and this is what it actually looks like it's called VG sales so video game sales into the CSV and you know here are the fields and we have our data and all we are going to do is we're going to download that and I will save it now when you download it it's going to be saved into a zip file so we need to go to our downloads let's refresh this here's our archive we need to go in here you can just copy it and paste it right back into here and just so you know that is a CSV so be aware of that so what we want to do is we want to come in here now since it is a CSV this is not we're not going to use Microsoft Excel we're going to be using the text file so we'll come in here we'll take VG sales now one thing I want to do before I do that is I'm going to rename mine VG sales I just go one I've already prepared for this and so I already have that in there but I so I want to make a distinct one for myself you do not have to do that so we'll come back here and then we're going to do text file and the VG sales we're going to open that up and when it pulls up right here you can bring in other tables and then you can start to join them together and create those relationships we're not going to be doing that in this video we'll do that in a separate one as for you know just getting started you know we're not going to be using that but you can see some of these things or some of these",

    "text": "What's going on everybody welcome back to the tablo tutorial series in this video we're going to be going over bins and calculated fields. Alright so let's jump right into it the first thing that we're going to look at are bins and bins are basically just groupings or ranges of numerical values. So we cannot create bins for genre name platform or anything like that we have to do something with this sign right here which means that it is a numeric. So year or all of the sales data or this ranking data and we're going to use what we worked on in our very first tutorial. And so what we're going to be using to kind of demonstrate how bins work is this year right down here. So right now we have a range of 1993 all the way up to 2018 and we're going to create some bins to group and create ranges for these years. And it's pretty simple all we're going to do is we're going to come right over here to year and this little drop down on the side and we're going to go down to create and go down to bins. Now it's going to say the size of bin and it's going to give you a recommendation based off of the information that is already provided the min and the max of the ranges of these values. You know you don't have to do this but usually it does give some good estimation on what you might be considering if you were thinking hey maybe do a bit of like 20 and they're recommending to think about why they might be doing that. We're going to change ours to five and you can always change what this field is going to be i'm just going to give it an old exclamation point just to really spice things up here. So we're going to click OK and as you can see it adds it right up here is no longer it is no longer a numeric now it is a categorical so it now it's this is no longer just one two three four five it's ranges its groups. And we're going to get rid of this year really quick actually let's keep it up there for a second see what happens but we're going to bring this up and we'll get rid of this year and this is is what kind of it spits out for us. Now I did look at the data when I was prepping for this there are some nils in the years and so all we're going to do for this is we're just going to go like this and we're going to exclude the nils. Probably not something you should be doing if you're doing this for work this is for demonstration purposes so we can do it every one. But as you can see we now have these ranges so this range starts at 1990 and it includes 1990 all the way up to 1994 and then it's 1995 to 1999. And so just really quickly we can tell that the years 2000 to 2004 were a huge huge huge season or group of years for game sales so these are the global sales for for these video games. And so it is really helpful it's very useful you can do this on a lot of different information we could do this on the sales data you can do this on age you can do it on years like we did and it can be very very useful and so really quickly that is how bins work I would say it's pretty straight forward. Now this is a perfect time to segue into the next part of the video which is calculated fields right over here on this left hand side we see that the global sales which are in millions goes all the way up to 900 million and created these beautiful bins right down here. But let's look at within these from 1999 to 2015 let's see which of these has the highest percentage of course it's going to be this one but we can do something called a quick table calculation will create a our own calculation later I'll show you how to do that. But we're going to do a quick table calculation and we're going to do the percent of total. And so now we have these bins and instead of just seeing the total amount of sales that they had we see the actual percentages based off these year ranges which is really useful something that you could absolutely put in some real work that you do for a client now really quick just to show you something that you can do if you click control and you drag this over here. You can actually save that calculation so we can say percentage of global sales and that actually saves it as you know a measure for us so that was a quick calculation but let's look how to actually create a calculated field. So if you do this right here what is going to come up is just the global sales and you can do a lot of what you would basically do in Excel multiplication division subtraction a few other things but we're going to keep it super super simple today all I'm going to do is I'm going to take global sales and I'm going to subtract I'm going to open bracket and I'm going to say EU sales and it auto completes for m",

Global sales minus EU sales and let's drag this over these are different once percentage one is in terms of some and so I'm just going to bring this in right here and so now we are comparing against the same thing and if we look at the global sales we have probably right around 950 million ish in this 2000 to do you know what I'm going to do is I'm going to do this again. So I'm going to do this in this 2000 to 2004 bin and for global sales minus the EU sales we're looking at you know 650 million so there is a noticeable difference and this is just one of the ways that you can use calculated fields to actually just show the difference between two numbers or you can do more advanced calculations depending on the data that you actually have. So I'm going to put it for this video I hope you learned a little bit more about bins and calculated fields in the next video we're going to be looking at a ton of different visualizations and graphs and charts and just exploring what options are really are out there for visualizing our data.

    "text": "Let's go on everybody, welcome back to the Tablet Tutorial series, and this video we're going to be looking at lots of different visualizations including the scatterplot and density maps. Now before we jump into the tutorial, I have some very exciting news. In just two days on October 7th, I am going to be partnering with Altarix to host a webinar. This webinar is completely for data analysts who are wanting to change careers to become a data analyst. Now you did hear that right, I will be the host of the event, but we will be bringing on guests as well who are industry experts who actually change careers to become data analysts much like myself. They'll be sharing their stories of how they actually transition careers along with the tools that they found extremely useful and helpful to make that switch, and they'll be giving lots of advice along the way. So if you are somebody who is wanting to change careers to become a data analyst or just wanting to learn about data analytics, this is an absolute fantastic place to learn a lot more about that. I will leave a link in the description so be sure to go and sign up for that. Again, I'm going to be there so it should be really fun. With our further ado, let's jump on to my screen and start the tutorial. Now we are about to look at a ton of different visualizations. Over here you can see just an array of them, but not all of them are ones that I actually think are useful or ones that I would actually recommend using. And so I'm going to take you through some of the ones that I absolutely think are worth learning and using and trying out. And I'm just going to kind of just show you how I might use them, how they might look, how you can navigate them a little bit. Now before we do that, we do need to go download one data set. It's this Starbucks location worldwide. Yes, we're going to do a little bit of longitude latitude here. And all we have to do is click this Downloads button and it will download. We're going to do that into downloads. We'll save that. Yeah, I've already done that, but you know, I'm doing this with you guys and doing it for you. So let's go to our downloads. Now we have here, we want to come in here, we're going to copy it or you can cut it. And then we're going to paste it here. Yeah, replace it perfect. And now we have it ready to go. We'll come in here. Let's do a new sheet. And I already have it in there, but I'm just going to show you what I would do a new data source. We'll do text file. We'll do directory and we will open it. And let's see what data we have in here before we actually begin. Just super quickly. We have the brand. So whatever company has it and then a bunch of location information. Street address, city, the state. This is all in the United States. So that's basically it. And what we are going to do is we're going to go over to this sheet three. And we have this directory two. That's what I just pulled in. Exact same thing as directory. But to the first visualization that we are going to look at is a bar and line graph. So what we're going to take is the year right here. I take these global sales and these and a sales. And we're going to be doing this one right here. So this has a combination of two separate types of visualizations. So sometimes you just have a line. Sometimes you just have these bar graphs or these bar charts. And we're combining the two. And it's very nice. I like how this looks. Now if you notice that I put this and a sales behind it, now it kind of cuts off. So now this global sales is in front. We're going to put that back. I just wanted to show you that right here. There's all some of global sales, some of an a sales. So if we go into this all, we click this dropdown, we can change it to a line. We can change it basically whatever we want. I just hit control Z to reverse that. But what we can do is we can go in here. And we can change this color. And let's see if we can just make it red. That possible. See what I did. I made it orange. That works for me. Just something to stick out a little bit more. Choose whatever color you want. And this is a really nice visualization. This is one that I have used in the past. We're looking at global sales versus the an a sales. And so it's very easy to see the distinction between the two and how one was doing a specific year versus how the other one was doing in that same year. So I really like this. If you want to do something like kee",

And so it's very easy to see the distinction between the two and how one was doing a specific year versus how the other one was doing in that same year. So I really like this. If you want to do something like keeping it consistent, you can do two bars. I don't really like this one as much. And you can again, you can really change it up. There's lots of different ones that you can do. Again, I prefer the line, but you know, do whatever you think is best. I'm going to change it back because this is not how I want to keep it. But there you go. So that is the first one that we are going to look at. Let's move on to the second one. And we actually will be using our Starbucks data here. Now, when you bring in data that has any type of map or address or postal code or things like that or country, it's typically going to create this latitude and longitude. It's going to generate that. Now, what we want to do is bring this longitude right up here and this latitude right there. And if you do the show me right now, it's giving us this. But what we want to do is add what we're looking for. So what will we actually be trying to search for on this map? You can do anything from like a postal code. And it will drag us right here. Let's come over to this. This allows us to kind of scroll around a little bit. We're going to mess around with this one for just a little bit. And you see if I can. That's nice. That might be too big. Let me back up one. So at least in the continental US a little bit down here, these are the postal codes. So right now, we're looking at post codes. And there are a lot that you can do with this. Really color will make almost no difference. It just becomes this mess. So you don't typically want to do something like that. At least not for this. Let's go to size. And if you make it really small, you can kind of see these groupings, these pairings, typically of like larger cities or major metropolitan areas. And so you can do this. And it's really, really easy. I don't recommend labeling this. I don't even know if you'll do it. It would be an absolute mess to try to label all these post codes. Well, let's bring this out. And let's bring these state and provinces in. Now right now, we have these little tiny, tiny dots on here. And I think what we want to do is not increase the size. But over here, we want to actually do this and make it a map. So now it's going to fill in all the states. We can, you know, why not? We'll add some color here. But we can, oh, it has a number. I didn't think they were numbered. Oh, that's interesting. I haven't seen, I didn't look at that before. I just found that interesting. But now we can see what what states Starbucks is in. And as you can see, they're in all 50 states. But it's something interesting to look at to think about. Now if we go right up here, we can again choose a different type. And we're going to go to the density. Now right now, it's just doing a density on the state. I'm bringing it right to that. We're going to bring back postal code. I'm just switching it up on you a little bit. And you can do it as small or as big as you'd like. You know, I like to do somewhere in the middle. Probably you write a name. But there's fine. I don't think it's going to make sense to really add any color here. Again, all these postal codes are different. So it's going to be complete mishmash. But this is kind of how you can use a density map. And you can do this with countries. You can do this with postal code. You can use any type of kind of like address or location-based data. So that is how you can use a map. Again, there's lots of different ways to use a map. And so I'm not going to show you every single way.

But in a really brief way, this is how you can use a map to actually visualize your data that does have location-based information in it. So let's go over to sheet three. And this data that we have over here, it just allows for a lot of different types of visualizations. So we're going to use this one. And there are lots of other ones that you might see out there. Like this one right here, we obviously wouldn't be using this. We might do something like this, change the label, and maybe add, why are both of these in here? Let's get rid of this. Oops, that's not even. Let's actually add that. Let's do these some of global sales. And we'll just make that into a label as well. So what you can do with these and how you're able to use them and visualize them. Again, these are not, well, you'll see these often, but these are not often ones that I would recommend you use. That's very similar to these packed bubbles. You can add these global sales in here again, add the label. It just, it sometimes is not as straightforward the information that is trying to tell you, right? You kind of have to search for it a little bit. You kind of have to look around. But you can find some good visualizations in here for very specific types of data. And so these are just ones to consider. One that you'll see all the time is this guy right here. And let me see if I can expand this a little bit. This is very small. Let's see. I have the size of global sales and label that the size. I don't know how I expand this. I haven't done this in a while. You just expand this. I don't use pie charts. What is happening? This is a incredibly large pie chart. Oh my gosh. I am making this. This is becoming a problem. There we go. And what I actually wanted to do is label the genre as well as I've been doing it all the other ones. And we'll label this. Now look, whether you are a fan of pie charts or not, you have to understand that people use them. Some people just like how they look. And for certain data, it can do well. For things that have a lot of different groupings or categories. It usually isn't super great. But it does give you some type of order of things, give you a quick glance. And people use them. Right. So let's not pretend like it's like the the hideiest stuff child. All right. People use it. People have it in their dashboards and their visualizations all over. So it's best to just know what they look like. Know how to do them. Know how to use them best. Again, I'm not a super huge, huge fan of it. Myself, I've used it once or twice, but one to look out for. And again, you can come over to here and use is called a box and a whisker plot. It's good for these large distributions. You know, this is like the median upper, upper, lower, lower. I don't use these a lot, but I know a lot of people who love them. Something to just look at and consider messing around with a little bit. It's pretty, I think, straightforward. And it does give you some good insight into your data if you know how to use it. Now, there is one last one that I want to show you. I'm just going to create it on a new sheet. Make it easy. We'll do year here. We'll do some of the N.A. sales. Why not? And we're going to make this like this. Now, it's very similar to a line chart, but when we break it out by the genre and we add some color, you know, it's just a different way to visualize this information. You can potentially add some stuff in here, like some labels if you want to, depending on how it looks for you. But this is just another way to visualize the data.

But the first ones that I showed you, the ones I pointed out as the ones that I really wanted you to know are great visualizations to learn how to use and learn how to make useful for the data that you have. With that being said, that is all that we are looking at in this video. Again, I've tried to keep it super easy. Just wanted to show you some different visualizations, the data that you can use to get those visualizations, and just some other options in case you wanted to get a little bit spontaneous, a little bit out there, a little bit funky to show your boss or something like that. Thank you guys so much for watching. I really appreciate it. If you like this video, be sure to like and subscribe below, and I will see you in the next video.",

    "text": "What's going on everybody welcome back to another video today we're looking at joins in tablo Now before we get into the tutorial I want to give a huge shout out to today's sponsor and that is Youdmi they were having a massive black Friday sale so everything is about 85% off So if you've been looking at a course now is the time to buy it If you were looking at learning and taking an actual full tablo course There are fantastic ones on you to me that I have taken myself So be sure to go and check out you me while they're having this huge sale I will include a link in the description if you want to check them out now let's get into the tutorial All right, let's get started and first we're going to start off in excel I'm going to kind of walk you through the data that we're working with and then we're going to put it into tablo And I'm going to show you how to do all those joins in tablo So the first table that we have is this demographics table we have employee ID Name employee employee age and employee gender Now look right here because this will be important going forward in the demographics table We have 10 Individuals and they each have an employee ID now when we go to the job title We have our employee ID employee name and the job title But this one is missing uh, Ryan Howard is missing his employee ID And then the very last one There are only Seven employee IDs and no names And so we're going to use all of that and I'm going to show you How to actually do the joins in tablo Tablo does a really fantastic job of visualizing it for you So it takes a lot of the guess workout I'm going to include a link to my joins video in SQL because these two are very closely connected And and if you understand how the joins work into in SQL You'll understand how the joins work in tablo It's almost the exact same thing So with that being said let's jump over to tablo So I'm going to pull this up right over here And now we have uh, where we can connect to our data And so we're going to click Microsoft Excel I'm going to scroll down here to tablo joins file I'm going to open this up and they have it open so I can't use it So let me get rid of that And let's open it again Perfect So now what we're going to do and I'm going to show you how to actually open up the joins In a second but what you need to understand is when you first come here Tablo doesn't automatically allow you to use the joins They use something called relationships And there are joins on the back end But they call it relationships because they are inferring all of these things They're trying to go in and make that inference for you So it takes a lot of the work off of you And most of the time that works And and you know you just plug these two things in here Like a demographics and the job title And it is going to you know help you build those what they call relationships And you can click on this and learn how their relationships differ from joins Again, there's not a huge difference but is not as customizable And you can't as easily do left joins or full joins or all these things that we're about to look at So uh, I'm going to take this one off And what we're going to do to actually be able to look at the joins And and choose what joins we want to use is we're going to do the strap down We're going to click open And so now we are in a place where we can actually create the joins And again, it's just much more customizable and so Back when I was using Tableau regularly I would use the relationships when it was pretty simple and straightforward Because almost they almost always got it right But uh, you know the joins It just makes more sense in the way it visualizes it for me So most of the time I'd be using the joins So let's pull over this job title right here And it's going to make this connection now before if you remember just about you know 30 seconds ago when it connected I was just a line And and so it gave us this option down here to kind of edit the relationship But now it's giving us this visualization And so let's click on it really quick And what is going to come up is the different types of joins that you can do You can do an inner join, a left join, a right join, and a full outer join And then you can actually choose the different data sources and how you're connecting them So again, I'm going to walk through a little bit of this But I think the sequel video that I did on this shows it so well I would just highly recommend using that And I recommend learning sequel too so you know two birds one stem So I'm going to get into each of the joins How they work what data is going to be displayed And these visualizations are really going to be h",

Well the 10th one is not there and that is because In this job title employee ID it only went up to 109 and then Ryan Howard just didn't have an employee ID and therefore every reason So that data is going to be missing Now when you are using actual data sets Very large data sets which we will use in the next video when we walk through an entire project Um when you use large data sets this can be The difference between clean data and very wrong data and visualizing it correctly And showing completely wrong numbers and so you really need to be sure you understand how your data works together when you're doing these joins So how can we fix this how can we um Make it to where we can see all of the data well right now We're only making it to where if the employee ID is equal to the employee ID So we only are going to see through 109 and through 109 we're never going to see Ryan So there are two different types of joins that we could do to make it see it And then there's something else that we can join on to where we can see that data the first one that we can look at is the right Join in what this does is it's going to take everything that is the same But also everything from this job title table Regardless of if it has a match in the demographics table So it's pretty you know this visualization does it all It's going to show everything in the right table regardless And it's only going to show things from this table if there's a match So let's try this one and we should see Ryan Howard in the job title table So let's click on it And if we scroll down there's going to be no no no no no Until we get To over here where we now have the data That we had in that actual table But again, this was in a match and so we weren't able to see that data So this gives us a way to where we can see all of it All everything from that right table this job title table And now we're going to click on the full outer Now the full outer is going to take everything from both Regardless of if there is a match at all And so right here you're going to see Ryan Howard and Ryan Howard Now why are there two different rows for it? Well because any demographics table there was an employee id So we're seeing the employee id Ryan Howard his age and his gender And over here there was no match right But in the job title table again this one didn't have an employee id And so we are going to be able to see this data But over here it has no match And so that's why it's showing us two different rows It's because there was no connection there was no match there That's what a full outer join is going to do Now just for the purposes of seeing what this one does as well We have the left hand table And now we are able to see the 110 Or 1,010 that we didn't see before And it's putting in nobles over here because there's no match So that's that is what we have so far Now like I said just a second ago There is a way that we can do this Without using the employee id We're allowed to use a different join clause Now there is the name of the employee in both of them This one is called name of employee And in the job title it'",

Now I am super excited to start this series with you guys we're going to be breaking this up in about six or seven videos. I don't really like those super long videos where it's like four hours long I like breaking mine up in the chunks. So that's what we're going to do. This is the beginner series and so we're going to start with the very basics and we're just going to work our way up. And I'm going to walk you through every single step of the way it'll be very easy to follow. Everything will be provided for you so that all you have to do is really follow along and by the end of it you should know power bi a lot better. You should have a lot more confidence using it. Now before we actually jump onto my screen. I want to give a huge shout out to the sponsor of this video and that is you to me. You guys know that I absolutely love you to me. I've been using them for years and that is no exception when it comes to power bi. I am thinking something best power bi courses ever on you to me. So I highly recommend you checking out the ones I have in the description. These are ones that I actually took and I loved the mo",

I believe this link in the description. So you just click on it. Go to it and download it. We're going to click this download free button. And once we click it, you can go to the Microsoft store. And I already have it downloaded. So when you see it, it'll already say downloaded. But for you, you can go in here. You can click download and it will download it for you.

And it's going to open up this window and it's going to give us a lot of different options for where we can get data from. Now, some of these are free and some you need to upgrade from. But you know, just taking a quick glance through here, you have a ton of options. There's databases. There's, you know, blob storages. There's post great SQL or different SQL databases. There's Google analytics. There's a lot of places. And you can go through the process to connect to that data and you can pull that data in from those data sources. Now, for what we are doing, we're just going to be using an Excel. I'm going to leave the Excel that I'm going to be using in the description.

I need to select which sheets I'm bringing in. So we only have ones that's the only one we're going to bring in. So you can go ahead and load the data or you can click on transform data. It's going to take us to power bi power query. Which is going to allow us to transform our data. So I'm going to have an entire video on how to transform the data. But I'm going to give you a really quick glance at it to kind of show you what it is. So right up here, it says our power query editor. And this is the window to basically transform your data and get it ready for your visualizations. Now you can do this in Excel if you want to and do that beforehand or you can do it here. And there are lots of things that we can do in here. As you can see at the top, again, I'll have an entire video dedicated to just power query. But let's take a quick look at the data and see if there's anything we want to transform quickly before we actually go and start building our visualizations. So over here, we have the store where we purchased it. We have the product that we purchased, the price that we paid and the date that we bought it. Now the first thing that jumps out to me is that this just says date on it. We might want to say date underscore purchased. And we're going to hit enter. And if you noticed right over here on these applied steps, it says renamed columns. Everything that you do, every single step that you apply to transform this data is going to be right over here. And if I want to, if I go back and I say, no, I really didn't want to rename that column, I can just click X. And it is going to get rid of that and take it back to its original state. So again, I'm just going to say purchased. And we're going to enter that. Now this is our apocalypse food prep. So this is food that we're buying for the apocalypse for this example. And if we look at our products, we have bottled water, canned vegetables, dried beans, milk and rice and all that stuff makes sense, except for the milk. Milk will not stay or last long the apocalypse. So I think what we're going to do is going to filter that out really quickly and we're going to click OK. And right over here again, it says filt",

And it is going to actually load the data into power be high desktop. So on this left hand side, it immediately takes us to the report tab. And what we want to do is go right here to the data tab. And take a look at our data. So again, there's our date purchased. And as you can see, the milk is not in there. Another tab that we're going to take a look at. And again, in this report tab, this is where we actually build our visualizations. The data is where we can see the data and change it up a little bit and change some small things about it, like sorting the columns or even creating a new column. And over here, we have this other tab and it's called model. And this is especially useful when you have multiple tables or multiple excels and you need to join them to kind of connect them together. We don't have that, but in a future video, I'm going to walk through how to use this entire tab. So now let's go back to the data tab. And I want to just look at the data really quickly before we go over to the report tab, and we start building our first visualization. As you can see, I've been buying these different products in different months. So this rice, I've been purchasing in January, February, March and April. And I've been buying it from three different locations because I wanted to see if I was spending less money at one location on all of the products. Then I would just shop there in the future and save a lot of money or if there were specific products that were really cheap at one location, but others, they were cheaper at a different location. And so I should just buy like the dried beans at Costco, but everything else, I should be buying at Walmart. And so that's what we're going to look at in just a little bit. So let's go over to the report tab right up here at the top. There's this data section. So you can kind of choose if you want to add any more data. Now that we are here, we can also write queries or transform the data like we were looking at any power query editor window. Over here in the insert, we can add a new visualization or a text box.

Now over on the visualization section on this far right, this is a very important area. This is where a lot of the actual creating of the dashboards happen. So let's take a look really quick and we'll get into a lot of these things as we're actually building our dashboards. So we're not just sitting here looking and talking. We're going to be actually building and doing. All right. So we're going to click right here on this dropdown on sheet one. This is going to show us all of our columns. Now two of the things that we wanted to look at were, where are we spending the least amount of money buying the exact same product that'll help us determine where we want to shop. And the second thing was, should I be buying all my products at the same place? Or are there certain products that they're going to be cheaper at a specific store and I should buy it there? So let's start out with the first one, which we're just going to see with the store and the price. Where we're spending the least amount of money. And just out of quick glance, we can see we're spending the least amount of money at Costco at $210 versus Target, $219 and Walmart at $225. And that really answers our question, but we want to visualize it better, be able to see it in an easier way. So we're going to go right over here and we can click on a lot of these, but the one that probably makes the most sense is the stock column chart. And it's going to show Walmart target in Costco. Now they're all the same color. Let's add a legend. So we're just going to drag store over here down to this legend. And let's make this larger while we're working on it. So now we can see we're spending the most amount of money at Walmart right in between at Target and then at Costco is the lowest. And so right there, we know that Costco is the place to go for our apocalypse food prep, but is it going to be that way for every product? I don't know. Let's take a look. Let's put this up in this corner. And let's start a new one. We're going to select the product for sure and the price and probably additionally the store as well. And let's click on. Let's not do this one. We need a clustered column chart. That's what we need. Bring this over here. Let's expand this quite a bit. And so really out of glance, this is giving us everything that we need. We can see each product right here and we can see how much we're paying per store. And so for rice, we're paying it looks like a lot more for our rice at Walmart while at Target is actually where we are paying the least. Now if we look at all of these, it looks like for Costco, the only one that we're really paying a lot more on is on our rice, but for our dry beans, our bottled water, we're paying quite a bit less. And really it's pretty negligible for these canned vegetables or paying maybe what 60 cents, 50, 60 cents more per can. So that's pretty negligible. But for the big ticket items, we're really spending a lot less at Costco. If we wanted to spend to save just a little bit more money, we could go to Target for our rice. Now if I want to make this more like a dashboard and we're only keeping these two things, I'm going to kind of size them. Kind of like this. Whoops. I'm going to show you that in a little bit. I'm going to size them a little bit like this. So now that we have that looking good, we want to change the title of both of these. So what we're going to do is go over here in our visualizations and format your visual. And we are going to go to this general, go to title and now we can name in anything we really want for this. We're going to say best store or product. And while we're in here, one of the things that I wanted to do is I want to go to this visual. Go right down here to these data labels. Now we haven't added any data labels. So I'm going to click on you'll see exactly what it does. It just puts the labels and the numbers above it. You know, I actually like hover over it and see what it is. Now it is actually rounding these numbers. So what we're going to do is go down here. We're going to go down to values and we'll get down to display units and it's on auto. So it's auto rounding those numbers. And we're just going to say none. So we can see the actual value of these numbers. And we can do the exact same thing over here. Probably is a good thing to do. And it just is going to visualize it a little bit differently in here, but you can always change that if you want to go over here to title. We're going to say total by store. And now we're going to take a look. And so in a matter of minutes, we were able to take our data from an Excel, put it into Power BI, transform it a little bit. Then we were able to create these visualizations that gave us concrete answers to some very important topics. We now know that Costco is the place to go from basically every single product except if we're buying rice. And if we want to save just a few dollars, we're going to head over to targe",

And in that video, we went through and we bit bought some rice, some beans, water, vegetables, and milk all of the apocalypse getting prepared for that. Now we decided to buy some additional things like rope, some flashlights, duct tape, and a water filter, several water filters. And after we purchased those, our boss or whoever working with, there's somebody decided to go and make a pivot table. Now in this pivot table, they kind of broke it out by Costco, Target, and Walmart, and had all the items, had some subtotals as well as some grand totals right here. And then they decided to kind of copy and paste that into this. And you'll see this a lot when you're working with people who use Excel, they like to kind of make things like this, maybe make it into like a table or format a little bit differently, but you'll see stuff like this a lot. So this is what we're going to actually pull into power query and work with. Now we're going to imagine that this is all we have. This is the only thing we were working with, and I'll kind of reference this pivot table a little bit. But we're going to pretend this is all we have, and we want to transform it to make it a lot more usable to where we can make",

    "text": "power query. So let's click on transform data. So now really quick, before we actually jump into working through this and transforming it, I want to show you what the power query editor looks like. So if we go right over here, we have our queries. And these are the tables that we actually pulled in. And we can click on those and kind of go back and forth between them. Now up top, we have our ribbon. And the ribbon offers a lot of functionality. We have things like remove columns, keep rows, remove rows, split columns. These are all things that we're likely to use when using this power query editor. There's also another tab called transform, where there's a lot of functionality here as well. Things like unpivoting a column or transposing columns and rows and using a first row as a header. Some of the things that we'll be looking at today. There's also another tab called add a column. And this one's pretty self explanatory, where you can add additional columns, like deleting a column, creating an index column, or a conditional column. Those are the three main ones. There's also view, tools, and help. But we're not going to really be looking at those today. And then on the far right side, we have our query settings. You can do things like change the name, so you can call it pivot table 2022. And it'll update right over here on our query side. And we have our applied steps. Now our applied steps are extremely important and very, very useful. Anytime we make any change to transform this data, it's going to be documented right here. And then we can go back and look at it, or we can even delete that change in the future. If we want to, and go back to a previous version of what we just did. So when we loaded the data into Power BI, it did a few things for us. It chose the source, the navigation, and it promoted the headers, and then it also changed the data type. So if we want to check, we can actually see those things, or change those things, like this source right here. You can click on this little icon. And it's going to bring up the actual path, where we got this file. So if we wanted to change that, or it changes in the future, we can come here, and we can change this file path. But we're not going to do that right now. So let's click on cancel, and let's go back down to change type. So it promoted these headers, and obviously these headers are not correct. We're looking at this pivot table, and not the purchase overview. But it changed these column headers. And so in the future, if we wanted to, we could easily change those, but it did that for us, and it changed the type as well. So if you look right here, it says ABC123, all the way over here, it's where it just says ABC. ABC means it's only going to be text, where ABC123 means it could be. So basically anything text, or it could be numeric. So now let's go over to purchase overview. And this is the one that we're actually going to be working on the most. But we might be looking at pivot table, just a little bit to kind of reference it, and see some of the differences. So before we do anything, let's just take a look at how Power BI decided to ta",

There's also all these blank columns right here at the top and kind of these null values as we go along. And we'll take a look at those.

So before, if we went to before we removed the headers, these were all ABC123, ABC123. So they had a lot of different data types in there. So it just kind of made a generic data type. But when we promoted these headers, the first thing that it decided to do was also change this data type for us, giving us its best guess as to what this data type is. And it decided to do this decimal. So this one, two is a decimal. But we're actually going to change that. And all you have to do is click on this 1.2, or the data type that it has right here for you. And we're going to click on fixed decimal number. And let's do replace current. And now it's just a little bit better. So now it's 2.70, 2.5. And that's normally how we would read values like this, because this is money.

Now we got rid of this column entirely. Now this looks really good visually. I like how this looks. I like how everything is set up. The biggest thing about this is that when you're actually wanting to use this for visualizations, these columns as dates doesn't really work too well. And so what we're going to want to do is, we're going to want to transpose this or pivot this to where these dates are actually rows. So what we're going to do is select the first date, which is January 1st, all the way through April 1st. And we're going to hit Shift and click on that April 1st right there to select all of them at the same time. And then we're going to go over here to the Transform tab. And we're going to click Unpivot Columns. And let's see what this does. And so now what we've done is we've basically recreated our original Excel that we had. So let's go back and take a look really quickly at that. So this looks almost identical to what we have in Power BI right now. And this is extremely usable and very good for visualizations. And is much, much better than this. But again, we were pretending that this is what we were given at the beginning. So you have to imagine somebody just handing you this and you need to make it much more usable for visualizations in the future, which happens a lot. And we actually wanted to create this. We just weren't given this. Now, a few last things that we might want to do is we want to clean this up just a little bit. We're going to select the data type and change this to date. And then we're going to select the value. And I double clicked on the value and I actually want to call this cost or product cost product underscore cost. And then for the location, I actually want this to be called store. So now this looks really good. But I want to show you one thing really quickly on this pivot table 2022. So let's go back here. This looks very similar to how we had it when it first started. One thing I wanted to show you really quickly. And I want to click on this first one. We're going to make this our column header. And then we're going to try to pivot or unpivot this January, February, March, April. So really quickly, let's do that. So we're going to transform use first row as headers. So now we have this January, February, March, April. Now, if you notice, these are not dates. These are actually text. It says January, February, March, and April. So if we go to do this and we click on pivot. And here's the columns that are created when we unpivot it. It is January, February, March, and April. These are not dates. So we cannot go and change this to a date because that would error out because it's actually text. So it's something that you want to look out for. It's something that you need to be aware of. And you can change that in the pivot table. So you want to be aware of how it actually sits and looks in the Excel or w",

We realized we were buying so many products for the apocalypse that we decided to start our own store and we have several customers and some client information down here. And so I wanted to take a look at some of the columns and these tables that we're going to be looking at. First thing we have is the apocalypse store. These are the things that we are selling. I know it's a very limited inventory, but these are the really high sellers. These are the ones that I wanted to sell. So we have this product ID, our product name, price and production cost. Then we have this apocalypse sales. This is how many sales we've actually made to our customers. So we have this customer ID, our customer name, product ID, order ID, unit sold and the data was purchased. And then we have our customer information right here. Here are all of our clients. So we have this customer ID, customer address, city, state and zip co",

From my experience, Power BI actually does a really good job at creating these relationships automatically. But we're going to go in and take a look at these and kind of see what everything means. And then we're going to go back and create these relationships from scratch, just to make sure that we know how to do every single part. So to get us started, let's double click on this line, connecting the customer information table to the apocalypse sales table. And it's going to bring up this edit relationship page right here. So this line right here connecting these two tables actually gives us quite a bit of information without actually having to click into this edit relationship page. What this is showing is that we have a one to many relationship. And there's only one or a single cross filter direction. And you can find both of those things right down here. And I'm going to walk through what those mean in just a little bit. On this page, you can also see the columns that Power BI decided to choose in order to tie these two tables together. Now, for our example, they decided to use the customer and customer right here from the customer information table as well as the apocalypse sales. But I don't really want to use those specifically because on this apocalypse sales table, I might remove this customer information and just keep the customer ID. And may have chosen these customer columns because they have the exact same name and really the same information. But I want to use this customer ID anyways. So what I'm going to do is I'm going to click on that column and click on this column. And then I click OK. And if we go back into it by double clicking aga",

So opening this back up, let's go down here to this cardinality and cross filter direction. Cardinality has several different options that you can choose from. You have one to many, one to one, one to many and many to many. Now for this example, we're looking at apocalypse sales and we're going apocalypse sales down to customer information. Now, there are a lot of rows in the apocalypse sales, but there's very few in this customer information. And there's only one customer per row. Whereas in the apocalypse sales up here, the customer can have several rows for several different orders. So that's why the cardinality is many to one. Now, if we flip this and we say",

Now, let's look at the cross filter direction. And there's only two options here. It's either single or both. And if we choose both and we click OK, this now goes from a single arrow pointing in one direction to two arrows pointing in both directions. But what does this really mean? So in order to demonstrate this, I'm going to put this back to a single direction. And what we're going to try to do is connect the data over here or the columns over here to the column in this apocalypse store. So let's go over here to build a visualization. And what we're going to do is going to take this customer information. And let's just say we want to look at state. So I'm going to click on state right here. And I'm just going to make this into a table. And the customer information table is only tied right now to this sales table. So we're actually going to go over to the apocalypse store. And we want to see how many product IDs are being bought in these different states. So really quickly, we're going to come up here and create a new measure. And all we're going to say is this measure is the count of a apocalypse store product ID. And we're going to create that. And now we're going to select it. So it's added to that table. So now what this is showing is that there are 10 product IDs, which there are 10 products for each of these states. But that's not actually technically correct because not every state purchased these 10 different items. If we go back to our model and we change both of these to a both direction, then we're going to go back and see what changed in our numbers. So now let's go back to our visualization. And now we can see that Minnesota actually only ordered seven different product IDs, Missouri eight, New York nine and Texas 10. This is actually much more accurate than before. When you use the both option, it takes these tables and treats them as if they are a single table. But the single op",

The more tables that you add and the more relationships that are created, but this is how you're going to actually create the relationships in the model tab within power BI.

So let's go over here and we're going to say count and as we're typing it's automatically giving us options. It has something called IntelliSense. If you've ever used other Microsoft products and telecents is their kind of auto completion that helps you look at other options very quickly. And so we're just going to click on this count and it's prompting us to put in a column name. And so we can come down here and we can select one or we can type it out and it'll try to predict and help us choose which column to select. So for us we're going to use this order ID but let's just start typing it out. We'll say order ID and then we can click on it and we're going to close this parentheses and click enter or you can go over here and click this check mark where we're just going to click enter. And so over on this right side it finalized that and saved that and we can actually look at that by clicking on this box next to it. And we want to look at this in a table. So now we can see that there are 74 sales. Now for this we want to see who's buying our products. We want to see what our client name is. So we're going to go over here and we're going to choose customer and we're going to put customer on top of sales and we're just going to take a look at like this.

Now they have the most orders with us but it doesn't necessarily mean that they're spending the most money with us but we can take a look at that later.

It is very similar and remember these are both Microsoft products so there's going to be similar functionality in both of them. And so this DAX is going to have a lot of similarities to exactly how it has in Excel. So we're going to do an open bracket and now what we're going to choose is this unit's sold.

And it's going to show us that we have 3000 total products sold and we can go through here and see what the big sellers are and probably the biggest one that I see right off the bat is this multi-tools survival knife. So these DAX functions that you can write can be very simple and lead to really good insights that you can use for the visualizations later on. Now I want to take a look at the difference between something like sum which is an aggregator function and something like sum x which is an iterator function because if you add x to some of these aggregator functions you can create them or or make them into an iterator function. So you can have sum and sum x or average and average x adding x onto the end of them can make them into an iterator function. So let's take a look and see how that actually works. I'm going to show you the difference and then I'm going to talk through the difference at the end. So really quickly let's go back to our data and let's go to the apocalypse store. Now what we have right here is we have the price and we have the production cost and we want to see how much profit we're getting from each of these as well as we can take a look at the unit sold and see how much money we are actually making. So what we're going to do is we're going to come back over here we're going to go to apocalypse store we're going to right click and create a measure and in just a little bit we're going to be creating a new column and that'll kind of show the difference really well. So we're going to create this new measure and we're going to name it profit and we're going to come over here and what we're going to do is we're going to take the sum we're going to start with our sums we're going to take the sum of the price and then we're going to close that parentheses and we're going to subtract the sum of the production cost. So all that does is it says if something costs $20 if we sold it for $20 and it only costs us $10 that's $10 and profit for that item and then what we're going to want to do is we're going to actually want to encapsulate that really quickly because we're about to use multiply and then we're going to sum and now we're going to take the units sold so how many units were actually sold at that profit that we just made. So let's see if that works and let's click the check right here and so we have the profits let's click on the profit. Oops it's not what I want to do let's use a new one I was creating a new table we're going to click profit and let's make it a table and I'm going to pull this right over here. Now we have our profit but I really want to know is which customer is spending the most money at my store. So we're going to come right over here we're going to click on customer and customer at the top and just at a glance we can see that Uncle Joe's prep shop is spending the most money at the store. Now what I want to show you is different since some and some X so what I'm going to do is I'm going to go back to this profit and going to copy this this entire thing and we're going to go back here to this table. Now we just created a measure and we were able to break it down by each customer. So let's go back over here now let's go up here to home and we're going to create a new column and we're going to call this profit underscore column and we're going to literally paste the exact same thing into here and we're going to hit enter and each row is the exact same thing. So what it's doing is it is going through the price and it's adding all of it up and calculating it at the bottom. It's adding the production cost it's going all the way down and calculating it at the bottom and then it's going over and looking at how many units it's sold and then it's performing this calculation up here and then it gives us the total and it's doing it for every single row but that's not really what we want it to show what we want it to show is the profit for each row. What we want to say is here's the price for the rope the production cost for the rope and then how many units we actually sold and then it'll calculate that and give us the actual profit for just that row but we cannot do it by just using this sum. What we need to do is use something called sum x. So let's add another column let's go back to home I'm going to say new column and now we're going to say profit underscore underscore column underscore sum x. And now we're going to use sum x and hit tab and we need to choose the table that we want to put this in so we're going to say apocalypse sales because that's the table that we're looking at right here. We're going to say comma and now we need to input an expression which it says it returns the sum of an expression evaluated for each row in a table before when you're just using sum it's looking at all of these combined now it's taking it row by row. So what we're going to do is basically input the same thing as we did before I'm going to copy I'm going to paste that it's not going to be correct I need to get rid of these sums but it's basically the exact same equation. Let me just a second and let's get rid of this sum and let's see if this works so let's click the check button and now this looks a lot better. So what this is now showing us is at a row level this nylon rope made us $51,000 almost $52,000 the waterproof matches made us $15,000 and we can go down and look at each item and see how much that actually made us versus this",

Hopefully that made sense I know that sum and sum x and the difference between an aggregator function the iterator function can be a little bit confusing especially if you've never done it before but hopefully that was a good example for you to understand that concept. Now let's go back over here to apocalypse sales right here we have a date purchased now in the docs function we have some ways that we can interact with dates and so I want to take a look at those really quickly. So we're going to go right up here and click on new column and we're just going to leave that as column but what we're going to say is day. So there's a few different ones we have day dates ytd next day previous day and weekday and they all are pretty self explanatory if you click on it let's click on weekday it says it's going to return a number from one to seven identifying the day of the week of a date. So let's use this really quickly and so we're going to say date purchased and click tab hit comma and it's going to give us a three different options basically it's a one a two and a three right here if you hit this button read more you can read more on it this is going to say Sundays equal to one Saturdays equal to seven I like this one personally which is Monday equals one in my brain it just makes more sense so I'm going to click on two I'm going to close that parentheses and we're going to guess I'll say let's say day of week for the column let's click that checkbox and now Saturdays are equal to sixes Mondays are equal to one this allows us to see which day of the week people are buying the most products on or which day of the week is somebody submitting their orders on and so let's go over to our report let's get rid of this it's going to move this oh geez I hate moving stuff sometimes all right really quickly I want to show you the difference between what we just did and what we already have so we have this date purchased and let's make that into a bar graph and what we're going to be taking a look at is actually the units sold so right here we have this and obviously for we don't want 2022 we're going to get rid of the year we only have one quarter right here we can see January February March so we can tell that January has the most sales or the most units sold in that month we get rid of that we go down today we do have some information but we don't know what day of the week it is it could change from month to month and it's really hard to tell exactly what if there's any pattern there at all that's where what we just created comes in handy so let's recreate this exact same thing but instead we're going to use day of week so we're going to select day of week and units sold let's drag that down so right here and this day is a week should be on the x axis and it's really easy now to see if there's a pattern here there's really not at least not for this fake data that we have but just I want these data labels on really quickly it's not easy to see if there's any pattern again Monday has the most so maybe that that I mean it goes down a little bit and then it picks back up so maybe middle of the week is our least sales day our Wednesdays and Thursdays are a little bit lower than the rest and the beginning and the end of the week tend to be the highest again not a huge pattern but you know it's much easier to see if",

    "text": "What's going on everybody welcome back to the Power BI tutorial series. Today, we're going to be looking at how to drill down and visualizations. So when I say drill down, I mean you're basically adding another layer beneath the top layer of the visualization and when somebody clicks or drills down into that data, they can see more insights and more information on the top level of data. When you drill down, you can also drill up and I will show you how to do that in this tutorial. So without further ado, let's jump on my screen and get started with the tutorial. All right, so before we get started, I wanted to remind you that you can find the data that we are going to be working with in this tutorial in the description. You can go and download it from my GitHub. Now the two tables I'm going to be looking at are Pucklip Sales and Purchase Tracker. And if you've ever created any visualizations, you've probably seen something like this where you'll have the store and the price and this is the things that we actually bought. So this is the total amount of Pucklips prepping equipment that we bought and we'll put the store in this legend right here. And you've probably seen something like this. And if you're anything like me, you're going to be in a meeting and you're going to be presenting this and some higher up is going to be like, hey, Alex, Alex, great. But I want to see what things we actually bought and target how much this cost can you create a visualization for that. And you're going to be like, well, I could or I could use drill down. And so you could have done this in the first place, which you should. So what we're going to do is all we're going to do is we're going to say, we're going to say the product right here and these are going to be the actual things and we're going to put it right under store. Now you can't see these things, right? But there is a hierarchy here. So once we added this, these options became available. Let's take it out and all those just disappeared. And then we add it back right here. They came back. And so you can do right here, which is click to turn on drill down. You can go to the next level in the hierarchy or you can even expand all down one level in the hierarchy. So let's look at each of those really quickly. So let's click on this one. It's just going to turn on drill down mode. So now if I go and I click on target, it's going to drill down into these. And if we want to, I can then put product under this legend. And we can see all of those things. But of course, if we go back up, it's going to be all broken up into this cluster column chart, which is more like this, which isn't exactly what we were going for. But it works. Now let me get rid of this action once store in the legend. Now if we turn that off and we click, it doesn't do that anymore. So what it does now is it just highlights Walmart, it highlights Costco, it highlights target. So we're going to keep that on. But we can also do something called going down the next level of hierarchy. So let's click on that. And so now this is going to go down to the next level down to this product level, because that is the next level. And now it's going to show us each of those things, but it's going to have it broken out by the store. And so it's a completely different visualization, but all within the same realm of the data that we're looking at and what we actually care about. So let's go back up in the hierarchy. And then let's use this one right here, which is expand all down one level in the hierarchy. And so this one is again extremely similar, except it just visualizes it differently. And now what it's doing is Walmart rice, target dried beans, Costco rice. So instead of having it all like this one where it's stacked on top of each other, it's breaking it down individually. So this one column would become three separate columns. Now I'm going to minimize this right here. I'm actually going to go back up in the hierarchy. Just for visual purposes. Now I'm going to show you one more example. When you use this apocalypse sales up here, and this is one that I actually use all the time. So the one you've seen, you know, you'll get stuff like that, especially if you're like sales and stuff, but I work in operations, right? So I have a lot of order IDs, product IDs, stuff like that. Now this one, this one genuinely I use quite often. I'll have a customer. Let's make it. We'll just go like this. We have a customer and we have units sold. And let's use the customer as the legend. So let's make this one quite a bit larger. And I'll have something like this and they'll say, okay, well we want to see the order IDs that go with it because we want to know what orders are actually happening for each of these people. Obviously, I'm not using this exact data, but very, very, very similar. Now all you have to do is take these order IDs and slide it right under here under customer. And this visualization right here is something I've done a thousand times because what happens is is someone, some stakeholder in our company is saying, hey, Alex, we want this and we want to know we want to drill down on this IP address. We want to drill down on this certain database. We want to drill down on something and we want to see the orde",

You'll click on it and you can see every single order ID that's in there and then they can go and look those up in their system and resolve them or whatever they're trying to do with it. And it helps a ton and it's very, very useful. This one is extremely applicable and that's really all drill down is again, you have these different hierarchies as well. But for different things, it's not as useful as you can see. We also have this hierarchy, which again is not as useful. So it just depends on the data that you're using and how you want to use this drill down effect. But I promise you that drill down is used all the time, especially when you're giving presentations where people want to know more information than just the visualization that you're presenting. So I hope that this has been helpful. I hope that you understand drill down a little bit better. If you liked this video, be sure to like and subscribe and check out all my other videos on Power BI.

    "text": "What's going on everybody welcome back to the Power BI tutorial series today we're going to be taking a look at conditional formatting. Now conditional formatting may sound familiar because we looked at it in the Excel series and it's very similar how you use it in Excel versus how you use it in Power BI. Conditional formatting allows you to take a table or a matrix within Power BI and use those cells to color code them and create gradients and different visualizations within the actual table or matrix. I'm excited to start this one selection of my screen and get started with the tutorial. All right so before we get started if you want to use the data that we're using in this video you can find it in the description on my GitHub. Now conditional formatting is super simple and you've most likely used it in Excel before but you can also use it in Power BI and let me show you how to do that. So the first thing we're going to do is come over to our apocalypse storm and we're going to pull up our product name as well as the price. And what we can do is come over here and we're going to go to price and it has to be under the columns so you can't come over here and do this. We're going to come right over here to price and we're going to right click and let's go to conditional formatting and we have background color font color icons and web URL. Let's take a look at background color first is most likely the one that we'll look at the most. So we're going to get this pop up and I'm going to slide this over. Now there's a lot of different things we can customize in here and the first thing I want to take a look at is format style. We have the gradient and what it's going to say is the lowest value will be this color. Highest value will be this color. They'll give us this gradient color scale and so we use that in just a little bit but we can also create rules kind of like an if statement and if it is between this range in this range we'll give it a color. If it's between a different range and a different range we'll give it a different color. So we'll also try that one and then we have this field value and this one is one that honestly I don't use that much. I've used it maybe once and what you can do is select a text field like customer and you can do some summarizations on the first and last and that is it. So what we're going to do is we're going to look at gradient specifically for not the customer but we're going to go back to the apocalypse store and we're going to do it on the price. Now what I'm going to do is keep it as the count because this is what the default is and we're going to go back and fix it later. But what we want our lowest value to be is this bright green showing that it's a cheap product that's easy to purchase. The high value ones are going to be just the shade of red more expensive and we'll do it on the count. Now remember the count is on each of these and we're not doing a count of how many are sold. We're doing a count of each product so it's just one per row. So it all should be the same color. Let's take a look. So it is all the same color. But what we really want to show is the actual price, not just the count of the price. So let's go back to conditional formatting. We're going to click the background color again. And this time we're going to change the summarization. Now you can do some. You can do average minimum maximum. It really doesn't matter for this example. The number is the same regardless of really which one we choose. So we can just choose the minimum and it's going to choose the minimum of each row, which is the price. So we're just going to select minimum for this example. We'll select OK and it should correct it accordingly, which means the bright green is the lowest and it goes all the way up to the highest, which is the red. Now let's go over here to apocalypse sales. We'll add in the units sold. And let's move that out a little bit. And I'm doing that on purpose because we're about to look at something within the conditional formatting. So let's go to units sold and we'll look at the conditional formatting for this one. Now if you noticed, we now have a new one on here called data bars. Now we're able to see data bars on units sold and not price because unit sold is something like a sum and average, something that's aggregated. But let's take a look at data bars because I want to show you how to use this and then we'll go back to the background color. So for data bars, we are going to take a look at the lowest of the highest value. Again, we're going to go from bright green all the way to this exact red. And it's going to be from left to right. And what it's going to show you is if it is a positive number which all of these are, it's going to be a green bar basically representing the number that you see in here along this line. So let's click OK. And we're going to be able to see the highest numbers and let's scoosh this over quite a bit. So you can kind of get a better understanding. And we're going to do it from highest to lowest. So we sold the most multi-tool survival knives at 477. And so this entire bar, this row is entirely filled up or almost all the way filled up. While as it get",

While as it gets lower and as we sell only 182 solar battery flashlights, the bar is going to represent that and show that. Now I'm about to completely mess up this visualization on purpose because it's about to get very messy to show you that you can do a little bit too much. It is possible. What we're going to do is we're going to go right over here to this background color unit sold. And instead of gradient, let's look at rules. Now with the price, we just did a gradient scale. But we can do basically groups of these and say if a number is greater to or equal than this number, then it's going to be a certain color. And then if it's in a different range, we can give it a different color. So we're going to say if it's greater than or equal to zero, and we're going to say number, not percent. And if it's less than 266, because we have 265 right here, let's make it a nice like gold, beautiful, lovely, mustard gold. Just just great. Now we're going to say if it's greater than or equal to, I'll do 266 because this has less than 266, so it should be greater than or equal to 266 number. And if it is less than, we'll say 500. Now we want to do this one and we'll give it, let's do like a peach. And we'll click OK. And now we have another conditional formatting on top of that that can give us more information. Now again, you should not do this. There's just too many. Now let's go one step further and make it even more ridiculous and show you one more thing. Before I show you how you may actually want to use this, let's go back to Unit Sold. We're going to right click, go to conditional formatting, and you can do something called icons. Font color is the exact same thing as background color, except it changes the font. And so I'm not really going to look into that one. icons are very simple, extremely similar to Excel and how you've seen them. And the rules that you can apply to them are basically the same as what you're doing like a gradient. And it's these if statements that we saw before. Now it auto gives us this right here, which basically says 0 to 33%, 33 to 67, 67 to 100. If it's in the bottom third percent, it gives us this red. The middle is yellow and the top is green. So we can go through and change all of this, but honestly, this looks pretty good. So let's click on it. And so the ones that are our least sellers are these red ones right here. And the top sellers are up here. Now this is just based on Unit Sold and this looks absolutely terrible. So let's kind of take this exact information, but make it a little bit better. So we're going to create a new visualization or at least a new table. So let's click on product name and we'll take the price, Unit Sold and revenue. And what I think makes the most sense for looking at revenue is these data bars right here. But there's only one problem. I can't do that because it's not summarized like Unit Sold was. But what I can do is to get those data bars, because I can come right down here instead of saying don't summarize, I can summarize it. And I can just click the sum. So it now is summarized. It's the exact same number. But if I right click on here as sum of revenue, I go to conditional formatting, I can now use those data bars. And so we're going to use those data bars and we're going to say for the lowest value and the highest value. And let's just make it a nice, we have darker green. I don't want it to, wow, that's, that's hideous. Let's make it this color right here. A nice dark green. And there's no negative. So it doesn't really matter. I'm going to go left to right. And you can show the bar only. But we're going to keep it because I want to see it. And we're going to go just like this. We're going to order. And this is pretty telling. Honestly, I did not think the weatherproof jackets were performing so well. But I mean, they are by far a number one seller. So you know, our weatherproof jackets, multi-tool survival knives and the nylon rope are performing outperforming all of our other products. So those might be the ones that I focus on the most while duct tape, the N95 mass, then waterproof matches. I mean, those are, those are garbage. So I might be looking to",

But this is very much a simple thing that you can do to just add a little bit more information and actual visuals to this little chart or table that you're going to create. Sometimes it's just better to have these simple visualizations on this table rather than just having the numbers themselves. Makes it a little bit more easy to read and understand.

    "end_time": 300,
    "text": "What's going on everybody? Welcome back to the Power BI tutorial series. Today we're going to be taking a look at bins and lists. Now bins and lists are really useful because they allow you to group things together to analyze and visualize them easier. So in this tutorial, I'll show you how to create your bins and lists and then we'll create some visualizations to show you how it can be helpful. So without further ado, let's jump on my screen and you'll start with a tutorial. Alright, so before we get started, I wanted to let you know you can go and download the data that we're going to be using in this tutorial. In the description below is on my GitHub. So we are going to be looking at bins and lists today. And for this, we're going to be going over here to this apocalypse sales. And let's open up our data right over here. And we want to get apocalypse sales really quickly. I feel like more people would know what a bin is. So we'll kind of start with a list. Just go a little bit backwards than we normally would. I'm going to use this customer or we're going to use this customer column right here or a list really quickly and you can do that in two ways. You can come up here and you can right click on the customer and go to new group or you can come over here under this the field section on the far right and go to customer right click and click new group. So let's click on that now. And right now is only giving us the list type. It's not giving us bins because bins have to be numeric. So we really can't do that at the moment. So we're going to call this just customer groups or we'll actually call it list just so it's easier to recognize when we create it. And so all we're going to do is we're going to basically group these, but it's going to be called a list. And so what we're going to do is we're going to select and we're going to select and we're going to say group and click on this group button. And then it creates this Alex the analyst apocalypse, prepers and this prep for anything prepping store. So that kind of named it for us, but if we double click on it, then we can rename this. And we can call this the best prepping stores. And then we have these last two and we can we can click on one and then click control and click on the other ones. We get both of them. And then we can click group and we can call this and we'll double click and we'll call this the worst prepping stores. And then that's it. And that's all we have to do. And what we're then going to do and if you want to undo this and you want to switch it up and do whatever, you can click on group, but we're not going to do that. We're going to click OK. And here is the column that it created and it basically tells us what list we put it in. If it's uncle Joe's prep shop, that's in the worst prepping stores list. And if it's the Alex the endless apocalypse preppers, that is in the best prepping stores. So it's kind of like an if statement, you can even create a calculated column, do it on this customer create an if statement. This is just a lot faster and a lot easier than doing that, but it basically would do the exact same thing. Now you can use lists as well on things like numeric. So let's say we have order ID and we'll go to new group and it's going to auto go to bin because typically it's what you use, but you can do list as well. And let's say, you know, we want to say we're going to call these like we'll group these and call these the first what call this the first customers or the first orders because we're looking at order IDs. Look at the first orders. And then we will go back here. We're going on the left side. We're going to click. Oops, we're going to go back to the top. We're going to hit shift, group all of these and we'll say the latest orders. And you absolutely can do this. Again, this is kind of like an if statement, right? So you're saying if it falls between this range and this range, then it's called the first orders. And if it's between this range and this other range, it's the latest orders. Again, it's just a much simpler version of an if statement. So you don't have to write it all out. You can just have this user interface kind of do it for you. And it's really, really useful. So now let's talk about bins and buy for the easiest way to demonstrate this. And I'll show you one other way. But buy for the easiest way to show this is by using age. And so for absolutely no reason whatsoever, these customer IDs who are right here in this customer information, they decided to give us some of their buyer information who are actually buying their products on their website or in their store.

    "text": "other range, it's the latest orders. Again, it's just a much simpler version of an if statement. So you don't have to write it all out. You can just have this user interface kind of do it for you. And it's really, really useful. So now let's talk about bins and buy for the easiest way to demonstrate this. And I'll show you one other way. But buy for the easiest way to show this is by using age. And so for absolutely no reason whatsoever, these customer IDs who are right here in this customer information, they decided to give us some of their buyer information who are actually buying their products on their website or in their store. They just decided to give it to us as well as some simple demographic information. I don't know why. But what we're going to use bins for is grouping these age brackets. So you know, you might be interested and say, well, I want to know if my core population who are buying my products are within a certain range. You don't want to look at every single age because then it just, you know, on your visualizations, it's not going to look right. You want to kind of group them, make it easier to visualize. So what we're going to do is going to go through here and we're going to basically go by 10s. So 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60 and see what age bracket these people fall in. So we're going to go to age, we're going to right click and we're going to say new group. And we're going to go to bin and we'll leave it as a default age bins. And you can do two things. You can do the size of the bins, which splits it, which splits it by this number right here or you can go based on the number of bins. So if you only want to do five different bins, it'll calculate that for you. And you'll say, okay, if you only want five bins, you're going to have to do it at 12.2. If you want 10 bins, it could be 6.1. But it is completely up to you on how you want to do that. You can do the size and we'll just say every 10, which is what we're going to do. Or you can go through and then you can create, you know, the, how many bins you actually want. So let's go ahead and click OK. And it's going to create those bins for us. So if somebody is 78, we're going to be in the 70s bin. If somebody is 41, they'll be in the 40 bin. If somebody is 29, they'll be in the 20 bin and so on and so forth. So when we go to visualize this, we don't have, you know, 71, 72, 73, 74, having a lot more things on our visualization. It'll just be the 70 or it'll just be the 20. Now we can also use bins on dates as well. So let's go back to apocalypse sales. We have this date purchase. So we can create a bin for this as well. So let's go to date purchased. Let's go to new group. Now you can also create a list and that's totally fine if you would like to do that. And it would kind of look like this where you can go through and you can select it and you can say, OK, this group, all these dates, you can group those and say this is going to be January. And you can do that and that's totally OK. But for this one, we're going to do bins. I think it's a little bit easier to do bins because what we can do is go right here and we can specify what we want seconds minutes hours, days, months, or years. And so for the data that we have, it goes January, February and March. So we're going to do months and we're going to say the bin size is going to be one month. So each month should have its own bin. So the three bins total. So we're going to select OK. And as you can see on this right side, we have January of 2022. And that correlates to the January over here. Then it goes down to February and then it goes down to March. And then when we visualize this, we don't have to do this the hierarchy stuff that we do in here where we filter it down to months. We can just use this right here and that will be our months column. So now let's go over to our visualizations and we'll see how this looks really quickly. We're not going to look at all of them, but we will take a look at a few of them. So the first thing that we can look at is age. So let's look at the buyer ID and then we'll do age as well. And so let's spread this out. And we can see our distribution of our buyers. So it looks like we have very few who are in the 10 range, thank goodness. And we can even put the age right under here under the age bins. And we have this, now we kind of have this drill down. And so if we go right here, we drill down right there. This will actually give us the breakdown. So this is what it would have kind of looked like. Our visualization would have looked like if we had just kept it the age, because now we're drilling down into the age. And so it looks like we have one 18 year old and maybe a 20 year old as well. Let's go back up. Yeah, so it looks like we only have one buyer ID. Yeah, so it's only one 18 year old. So of legal age, just start buying, you know, all these prepping equipment and probably buying online and stuff like that, which makes sense, right? So this gives you kind of a qui",

And it looks like the best prepping store is actually performing much worse, surprisingly, than the worst prepping store. And so I hope this gave you a really good idea of how to use bins and lists within Power BI. Thank you so much for watching.

    "text": "What's going on everybody? Welcome back to the Power BI tutorial series. Today we're going to be taking a look at all types of visualizations. Now when you're working in Power BI, there are a lot of different options to create visualizations and you may not always be sure which one to use. And so that's what this video is for. I'm going to walk you through a lot of the visualizations that I like and I use a lot, as well as kind of point out some of the ones that I don't like as much So that you get kind of a feel for the ones that I think are really popular and then are used the most. So without further ado, let's jump in to Power BI and start taking a look. All right, before we jump into it, there is a link in the description where you can get the data that we're going to be using for these visualizations. If you want to practice them yourself, before we actually get into it, we do need to combine this. And if you download that Excel and you see this, you'll have to do the same thing. All we have to say is that this product ID is the same as this product ID purchased. And now we are good to go. Do one to many and it's okay if it's one way. So right over here under this visualizations tab, there are lots of different options. And it can be a little bit overwhelming. You don't only know which one to choose. There are some in here that I have almost never used for my job ever. So I'll point those out as we go through, but the main focus is going to be focusing on the ones that I do use that I have used and showing you how to actually cr",

And the very first one that we're going to start with, probably the easiest one in the one that you'll recognize the most is a stacked bar chart. And what we are going to do is go ahead right over here to the product name and we want this unit sold as well. So we're going to click product name and it's going to go straight into the Y axis for us. And then we're going to click unit sold and that will go into the X axis automatically. It just kind of intuitively knows, but sometimes it will make a mistake and then you can just fix it or flip it. And we do want this. Let me make this much larger. We do want this to be a little bit more color coded. That is what this legend is down here. So what we're going to do is drag this product name down to the legend. And now we have each product as its own color. And in previous videos, we have gone through and looked at some of these visual and general options that you have when you're actually creating these visualizations. But we're going to do some of them while we're in here as well. So we're just going to go down here, I'm going to choose data labels and we're going to shrink that. And if you go higher, the higher you go, the less you see. So if you want all of them all the way down to the green, we're going to go right about there and we're going to make it smaller. So now we can go ahead and click anywhere outside of that visualization and now we can create a n",

If we had just kept it like this where we were still interacting with this visualization and we clicked on a different one, it would have then changed our visualization completely which we don't want. So let's hit control Z, click out of it and now we can create a new one. Let's go right over here to this 100% stacked column chart. I'm going to click on it, try to get over here and make it much larger. And we're going to come right over here to this customer information and we're going to click on customer. And then we're going to go up to unit sold and click on unit sold and we want to break these out. And so basically what this is doing is it's breaking it out by each of these shops and we can see the total of what they're buying the units sold. But we want to see exactly what products make up this percentage or this 100%. So we're going to go right over here to product name. We're going to drag that down to the legend. And as you can see now we have each of these products and each of the products is up here so this backpack we can see the backpack right here, backpack right here and right here. And we can see which customer is buying what percentage of their purchases. So for this prep for anything prepping store, if a very large percentage, 40% is duct tape. So they're buying a lot of duct tape. So really quickly we're able to see what clients are purchasing or which clients are purchasing what products the most. So just like this Alex Anilis apocalypse preppers, they're buying a lot of water purifiers. We like drinking clean water. You know, that's just what my audience likes. And so, you know, we can easily get a quick glance of that. Again, we're going to go in here. I tend to like putting these data labels on here. That's just what I preference. So, you know, something like this, it looks nice, it looks clean. We can always go back and change these names, which we'll do for this one. So we're going to go over here, go to title. We'll go down to the text and we'll do customer. Oops. Customer purchase, oh geez, break down. Pretend I'm really good at spelling. And we're going to do it just like that. We'll get out of there. So now we have customer purchase break down and that looks really nice. It's a good visualization and we're going",

Another really common visualization is this one right here, which is the line chart. And the line chart is great, especially when you're using things like dates. I have found this one to be the best and a lot of people use this as well. So we're going to go right over here and click on date purchased and then units sold. And on the X axis, you can see it's broken up by year quarter month and day. So we don't want to do it that high level. We only have three months of data in here. So we're going to get rid of the year. We're going to get rid of the quarter and then we at least have this. And let's break it out because right now we're looking at all of the units sold. So we're going to drag the product name right down here to the legend. And now it breaks it out by the actual product. And for each month in January, February or March, you can follow these products and see how they did in each of those months. And if we wanted to, we can come right over here to the filter on the product name and we could filter it by maybe the top three. So let's do multi tool survival knife, the nylon rope and the duct tape. And we can have it just like this. And you know, you can do those for any product that you want. But again, we just want to do it for those three just for an example. And that really doesn't give us a ton of information. We can even go down to the day. And you know, it might give us a little bit more information. And so we'll keep it like that. And we can go over here, change the name as well. We're not going to do this for all of them. Again, we're just looking at the different types of visualizations. I think are really good to know. But we'll change this one as well to products purchased by date. We'll keep it just like that. Again, nothing fancy. We're just trying to look at a bunch of different stuff. So let's put this over here, down here. Now let's click out of there. And there are other ones in here that are definitely useful and you absolutely can use. Like this one is a stacked bar chart. This one is a stacked column chart. Basically, the same thing, just a different orientation. We went to here. It's just a different orientation. It's the same thing. Just like thi",

Then we have things like an area chart, stacked area chart, not really things that I've used too much in previous positions. One that I have used though is a line and clustered column chart. So it kind of combines a few of these with, you know, you have these bar charts as well as line charts into one visualization. So let's look at this one because this is one that I have used several times in my actual job. So for our x-axis, we'll use the product name. Then we'll look at something like the price. And so let's make this a lot larger. So you can actually see it. So now we have the price and now we can look at something like the production cost and that can be our line y-axis. So now we're looking at the price of it, how much someone is actually paying for it. And then we're looking at how much it's costing us to actually produce that product. And so really quickly at a glance, you can kind of see that it's around the halfway to two thirds point on most of these. You can see that the production cost is always lower than the a",

So let's use the price and the production cost again. And so our x-axis is the price, our y-axis is the production cost. But now we need to fill in this values right here. So let's go over here and click on the product name and drag that into values. And so now we have our values. We just don't know what they are, but we can see it. So let's drag this down to legend as well. And it breaks it out and we kind of have this scatter plot. And you know, for this fake data that we're using, it doesn't really show a lot.

Now let's go right over here and we have the dreaded pie charts and donut chart. Now look, I think it's kind of a joke in the data analyst community about pie charts and donut charts. But at the same time, people use them and they request them. And so sometimes you're going to use it, whether you like it or not. So let's click on the donut chart and let's make this one a lot larger. And let's go over here and let's click on state. And we're also going to click on total purchased. And that's really all you have to do. These ones are pretty straightforward. You can change a few different things like where these labels are. If you want them inside, you can also do that. Now it would look totally fine. Again, I'm just not a super huge fan, but you will get this one requested. People like this and want to see it. And the reason a lot of analysts don't like using this is because when you start glancing at these, it's really hard to tell the difference between these sizes. If you look at something like this, you can easily see that this is larger. Like if you're looking at this one, the multi-tool survival life is obviously the longest and it gets shorter, shorter, shorter, shorter. But when you start getting in here, it's really hard to approximate the size. I would not be able to tell the difference between this 5.63, 5.78, 7.72. I would not be able to tell really the difference between these or kind of the difference between them very easily. That's why a lot of people don't want to use them in general.

All right, the next two are super easy, but are used all the time. Maybe more than some of these even, but they're just so easy to use. So I'm kind of saved them for last. This one is the card. And all the card is, is it displays one number or multiple numbers if you want to use a multi-row card, but we'll just look at the card for now. All we're going to look at is the total purchase. And it's just going to display it just like this. And you can make it as large or as small as you'd like. And normally it goes on like the top and you'll put a card here, a card here. Just for example, I'll kind of show you how this might look. So it looks something like this, right? And at the top, it'll have different, usually high overarching information. And this is super common to see. And I'm sure if you've looked at other people's visualizations, you'll see something like this.

    "text": ". I'm going to show you how to install Jupyter notebooks. All right so let's get started by downloading anaconda. Anaconda is an open source distribution of Python in our products. So within anaconda is our Jupyter notebooks as well as a lot of other things but we're going to be using it for our Jupyter notebooks. So let's go right down here and if I hit download it's going to download for me because I'm on Windows but if you want additional installers if you're running on Mac or Linux then you can get those all right here. Now if you are running on Windows just make sure to check your system to see if it's a 32 bit or a 64 you can go into your about in your system settings to find that information. I'm going to click on this 64 bit. It's going to pop up on my screen right here and I'm going to click save. Now it's going to start downloading it. It says it could take a little while but honestly it's going to take probably about two to three minutes and then we'll get going. Now that it's done I'm just going to click on it and it's going to pull up this window right here. We are just going to click next because we want to install it. This is our license agreement you can read through this if you would like. I will not. I'm just going to click I agree. Now we can select our installation type and you can either select it for just me or if you have multiple admin or users on one laptop you can do that as well. For me it's just me so I'm going to use this one as it recommends. Now I'm going to show you where it's installing it on your computer. This is the actual file path. It's going to take about 3.5 gigs of space. I have plenty of space but make sure you have enough space and then once you do you can come right over here to next. Now we can do some advanced options. We can add an account of three to my path environment variable and when you're using Python you typically have a default path with whatever Python IDE or notebook that you're using. I use a lot of Visual Studio code so if I do this I'm worried it might mess something up so I am not going to do this. It also says it doesn't recommend it. Again messing with these paths is kind of something that you might want to do once you know more about Python so I don't really recommend you having this checked. We can also register in a kind of three as my default Python 3.9. You can do this one and I'm going to keep it this way just so I have the exact same settings as you do. So let's go ahead and click install and now it is going to actually install this on your computer. Now once that's complete we can hit next and now we're going to hit next again and finally we're going to hit finish but if you want to you can have this tutorial and this getting started with Anaconda. I don't want either of them because I don't need them but if you would like to have those if this checked and you can get those let's click finish. Now let's go down and we're going to search for Anaconda and I'll say Anaconda Navigator and we're going to click on that and it should open up for us. So this is what you should be seeing on your screen. This is the Anaconda Navigator and this is where that distribution of Python and R is going to be. So we have a lot of different options in here and some of them may look familiar. We have things like Visu",

So let's go ahead and click on launch and this is what should kind of pop up on your screen. Now I've been using this a lot so I have a ton of notebooks and files in here but if you are just now seeing this it might be completely blank or just have some default folders in here but this is where we're going to open up a new Jupyter notebook where we can write code and all of the things that we're going to be learning in future tutorials and you can use this area to save things and create folders and organize everything. If you already have some notebooks from previous projects or something you can upload them here but what we're going to do is go right to this new. We're going to click on the drop down and we're going to open up a Python 3 kernel and so we're going to open this up right here. Now right here is where we're going to be spending 99% of our time in future videos. This is where we're going to write all of our code. So right here is a cell and this is where we can type things so I can say print, I can do the famous hello world and then I'll run that by clicking shift enter and this is where all of our code is going to go. These are called cells so each one of these are a cell and we have a ton of stuff up here and I'm going to get to that in just a second but one thing I want to show you is that you don't only have to write code here you can also do something called markdown and so markdown is its own kind of you can say language but it's just a different way of writing especially within notebook. So all we're going to do is do this little hashtag and I think it's a pound side but I'm going to call it hashtag. I'm going to do that. I'm going to say first notebook and then if I run that we have our first notebook and we can make little comments a little notes like that that don't actually run any code they just kind of organize things for us and I'm going to do that in a lot of our future videos so I just wanted to show you how to do that. Now let's look right up here a lot of these things are pretty important. One of the first things that's really important is actually saving this. So let's say we wanted to change the title to I'm going to do a a a because I want it to be at the beginning so I can show you this. I'm going to a new notebook and I'm going to rename it and then I'm going to save that. So if I go right back over here you can see a a new notebook that green means that it's currently running and when I say running I mean right up here and if we wanted to we go ahead and shut that down which means it wouldn't run the code anymore and then we'd have to run up a new cluster. So let's go ahead and do that I plan on doing that but let's do it so we have no notebooks running and right here it says we have a dead kernel so this was our Python 3 kernel and now since I stopped it it's no longer processing anything so let's go ahead and say try restarting now and it says kernel is ready so it's back up and running and we're good to go. The next thing is this button right here now this is an insert cell below so if I have a lot of code I know I'm going to be writing I can click a lot of that and I often do that because I just don't like having to do that all the time so I make a bunch of cells just so I can use them you can also delete cells so see we have some code here we'll say here and we have code here and then we have this empty cell right here we can just get rid of that by doing this cut selected cells we can also copy selected cells so if I hit copy selected cells and I can go right here and say paste selected cells and as you can see it pasted that exact same cell you can also move this up and down so I can actually take this one and say I wanted it in this location I can take this cell and move it up or I can move it down and that's just an easy way to kind of organize it instead of having to like copy this and moving it right down here and pasting it you can just take this cell and move it up which is really nice now earlier when I ran this code right here I hit shift enter you c",

I'm going to say is equal to now we can assign the value to it. So let's say I want to put 22. X is now equal to 22. So we won't have to write out the number 22 in later scripts that we write. We can just say X because X is equal to 22. It now contains that number. So now we can hit enter and say print. We do an open parentheses and we'll say X. Now I'm going to hit shift enter and now it prints out that 22 because we are printing X and X is equal to 22. This is our value and this is our variable. One really great thing about variables is that it assigns its own data type. It's going to automatically do this. So we didn't have to go and tell X that it's an integer. It just automatically knew that 22 is a number. So we can check that by saying type and open parentheses and writing X. And we'll do shift enter again. And this says that X is an integer type. Now we only assigned an integer to X. Let's try assigning a string value or some text to a variable. So we'll say Y is equal to let's say mint chocolate chip. I'm feeling some ice cream today. So we'll say mint chocolate chip. Now if we print that again, we'll do print open parentheses Y and do shift enter. It'll print mint chocolate chip. And if we look at the type, we can see that the type is a string this time and not an integer. Now again, we did not tell it that X was an integer and Y was a string. It just automatically knew this. Let's go here really quickly. We're going to add several rows in here because we're about to write a lot of different variables and really learn in depth how to use variables. The next thing to know about variables is that you can overwrite previous variables. Right now we have mint chocolate chip and that is assigned to the variable Y. So if I go down here, I say print Y, I hit shift enter. It's going to print out mint chocolate chip. But if I go right above it, I say Y is equal to and let's say chocolate. If I print that out, it's now going to say chocolate. Whereas up here, I'm reassigning it to Y. It's still going to say mint chocolate chip. So if I come right down here and I copy this and I'm going to paste this right here, initially it is going to assign Y to chocolate. But then right here, it will automatically overwrite Y as mint chocolate chip. And when we hit shift enter, it's going to show mint chocolate chip. Variables are also case sensitive. So if I come up here and I say a capital Y, this is a lower case Y and this is a capital Y, it is going to pri",

Up till now, we've only assigned one value to one variable, but we can actually assign multiple values to multiple variables. So let's do X, Y, comma Z is equal to and now we can assign multiple values to all of those. So we can say chocolate and then we'll do a comma. Oops, a comma. Then we can say vanilla and then we'll do another comma and we'll say rocky road. Now this is going to assign chocolate to X, vanilla to Y and rocky road to Z. So what we can do is we'll say print and we'll go print print print. I'll say X, Y and Z. So it prints out chocolate, vanilla and rocky road and these are our three different values. We can also assign multiple variables to one value and we can do this by saying X is equal to Y is equal to Z is equal to and we can put whatever we would like. Let's do root beer, float, then we'll come back up here, we'll copy this and let's print off our X, our Y and Z and they are all the exact same. Now so far we've really only looked at integers and strings but you can assign things like lists, dictionaries, tuples and sets all to variables as well. So let's go right down here. So l",

So now within ice cream we have three string values chocolate vanilla and rocky road all within this list. So what we can do is we can say X comma Y comma Z is equal to ice underscore cream. So now these three values chocolate vanilla and rocky road will be assigned to these three variables X Y and Z and we can copy this print up here. And we'll hit shift enter and now the X Y and Z all were assigned these values of chocolate vanilla and rocky road. Now something that we just do which is really important or something that you really need to consider is how you name your variables. So right here we have ice cream. Now this to me is exactly how I usually write my variables but there are many different ways that you can write your variables.

    "text": "go a little bit longer than what we have. So there are a few best practices for naming variables. First I'm going to show you kind of what a lot of people will do. I'll show you some good practices and I'm going to show you some bad practices as well that you should avoid doing. The first thing that we're going to look at is something called camel case and let's say we want to name it test variable case. Oops case. Now if we have a test variable case the camel case is going to look like this. We'll have a lower case test and then we'll have uppercase variable and uppercase case is equal to this is what this variable is going to look like. And we can assign it a nila swirl. And this is what your camel case will look like it's going to be lower case and then all the rest of those compound words or however you want to say that these letters are going to be capitalized to kind of separate where the words end and begin. Let's go right down here we're going to copy this the next one is called Pascal case. So Pascal case is going to look just a little bit different instead of the lower case at test that's going to be a capital T in test. So test variable case again this is a very similar way of writing it very similar to camel case. But just a capital at the beginning. Now let's look at the last one and this one is my personal favorite. This one is going to be the snake case. Now this one is quite a bit different in the fact that you don't use any capital letters and you separate everything using underscore. So we're going to write test underscore variable underscore case. Now typically let me have them all in there. Typically these are the best practices. These are what you typically want to do. But probably the best one to use is this snake case right here. What a lot of people say is that it improves readability. If you take a look at either the camel case or the Pascal case, which you will see people do. It's not as easy to distinguish exactly what it says. And the name of a variable is important because you can gain information from it if people name them appropriately. So when I'm naming variables, I usually write it in snake case because I just find it a lot easier to read because each word is broken up by this underscore. So now let's look at some good variable names. These are all ones that you can use or could use. Let's do something like test var. So test var is completely appropriate. We can also do something like test underscore var. Oops, underscore. We could do underscore test underscore var. You'll see that often as well. Well, people will start it with an underscore. You can do test var. Capital T, oops, capital T capital V in test var. Or you could even do something like test var to now adding a number to your variable is not inherently a bad thing. Usually it's semi frowned upon, but there are definitely some use cases where you can use it. But one thing that you cannot do is do something like putting the two at the front. If you put the two at the front, it no longer works. It won't run properly at all. So we're going to take that out. So we can't do that. So I'm going to use this as an example of what you should not do. You also can't use a dash. So something like test dash var to that doesn't work either. And you also can",

    "text": "'t use something like a space or a comma or really any kind of symbol like a period or a backslash or equal sign. None of those things will work within your variable. Now another thing that you can do within your variable is use the plus sign. So let's assign this will say X is equal to and we'll do a string will say ice cream is my favorite. And then we'll do a plus sign and we'll say period. Now what this will do is it will literally add these two strings together. So let's do print and we'll do X. So now it says ice cream is my favorite. One thing that we cannot do in a variables, we cannot add a string and a number or an integer. So we can't do ice cream is my favorite to if we try to do that, it will give us this error right here. So in this error, it's saying you can only concatenate a string, not an integer to a string. So only a string plus a string for this example. You can also do and we'll say X is equal to I will say Y. We'll say Y is equal to three plus two and it should output five because you can also do an integer and an integer. Now so far we've only been outputting one variable in the print statement, but you can actually add multiple variables within a print statement. So let's go right down here. We're going to say, let's give it some more right there. So we'll say X is equal to ice cream and we'll say Y is equal to is and then the last one Z is equal to my favorite and we'll do a period at the end. Now we can go to the bottom and we say print X plus Y plus Z. And when we enter that and when we run and when we run that, we get ice cream is my favorite. Now we can actually add a space before is a space before my and when we hit shift enter, it says ice cream is my favorite. You can also do this exact same thing with numbers as well. So we'll say X is equal to one, two and Y is equal to three. So this should equal six. Now one thing that we tried to do was assign to one variable a string plus an integer and that did not work. But what you can do is you can take something like this and you can say ice cream and we'll get rid of this one. And we'll get rid of the Z. Now saying plus is actually not going to work. Let's try running this. So again, we can't concatenate these, but what we can do in the print statement is we can separate it by a comma. So when we add this comma, it should work properly. Let's hit enter and it says ice cream to again, this makes no sense, but you are able to combine a string and",

We have integers, float, and complex numbers. Let's take a look at integers and integer is basically just a whole number whether it's positive or negative. So an integer could be a 12 and we can check that by saying type. We'll do an open parentheses and a closed parentheses and if we say the type of 12, it's going to give us an integer or if we say a negative 12, that is also an integer. We can also perform basic calculations like minus 12 plus 100 and that'll tell us it is also an integer. So whether it's just a static value or you're performing an operation on it, it's still going to be that data type if those numbers are whole numbers, whether negative or positive. Now let's take this exact one and let's say 12 and we'll do plus 10.25. When we run this, it's no longer going to be a whole number. It'll now be a float. So let's check this. Now this is a float type because it's no longer a whole number. It's now a decimal number. And the last data type within the numeric data type is called complex. Let's copy this right down here. Now personally, this is not one that I've used almost ever, but it is one just worth noting. So you can do 12 plus and let's say 3, J. And if we do this, it's going to give us a complex.

Now let's take a look at Boolean values. So we'll say Boolean. The Boolean data type only has two built-in values, either true or false. So let's go right down here and say type true. And when we run this, it'll say, Boole, which stands for Boolean. We can do the exact same thing with false. And that it's also Boolean. And this can be used with something like a comparison operator. So let's say one is greater than five. And let's check this. This is giving us a Boolean because it's telling us whether one is greater than five. Let's bring that right down here. This wi",

    "text": "ll give us a false. So it's telling us that one is not greater than five. And just as we got a false, we can say one is equal to one. And this should give us a true. So now let's take a look at our sequence type data types. And that includes strings, lists, and tuples. We'll start off by looking at strings. In Python, strings are a raise of bytes representing Unicode characters. When you're using strings, you put them either in a single quote, a double quote or a trouble quote. I call them apostrophes. It's just what I was raised to call them. But most people who use Python call them quotes. So right here, we have a single quote and that works well. We can do a double quote and that works also. And as you can see, they are the exact same output. And then we have a triple quote, just like this. And this is called a multi line. So we can write on multiple lines here. So it's right. A nice little poem. So we'll say the ice cream, vanquished by longing for sweets upon this diet. I look away. It no longer exists on this day. And then if we run that, it's going to look a little bit weird. It's basically giving us the raw text, which is completely fine. But let's call this a multi line. And we're going to call this a variable multi line. I want to come down here and say print. And before I run this, I have to make sure that this is ran. So now let's print out our multi line. And now we have our nice little poem right down here. Now, something to know about these single and double quotes is how they're actually used. So if we use a single quote and we say, I've always wanted to eat a gallon of ice cream. And then we do an apostrophe at the end. Obviously, something went wrong here. What went wrong is when you use a single quote and then within your text, within your sentence, you have another apostrophe, it's going to give you an error. So what we want to do is whenever we have a quote within it, we need to use a double quote. These double quotes will negate any single quotes that you have within your statement. They won't, however, negate another double quote. So you need to make sure you aren't using double quotes within your sentence. If you want to do something like that, you need to use the triple quotes like we did above. So we can do double, double, and then let's paste this within it. And anything you do within these triple quotes will be completely fine. As long as you don't do triple quotes within your triple quotes, we'll say this is wrong. So even though it's between these two triple quotes, it doesn't work exactly. Again, you just have to understand how that works. You have to use the proper apostrophes or quotes within your string. And just to check this, we can always say, here's our multi line. We can always say type of multi line. And that is still a string. One really important thing to know about strings is that they can be indexed. Indexing means that you can search within it and that index starts at zero. So let's go ahead and create a variable. And we'll just say a is equal to and let's do the all popular. A little world. Let's run this. And now when we print this string, we can say a and we're going to do a bracket. And now we can search throughout our string using the index. So all you have to do is do a colon. We can say five. What this is going to do is going to say zero, position zero, all the way up to five, which should give us the whole hello, I believe. Let's run this and it's giving us the first five positions of this string. We can also get rid of the colon and just say something like five. And then when we run this, it's actually going to give us position five. So this is zero, one, two, three, four, and then five is the space. Let's do six. So we can see the actual letter and that is our W. We can also use a negative when we're indexing through our string. So we could say negative three and it'll give us the L because it's negative one, two and three. We can also specify a range if we don't want to use the default of zero. So before we did zero to five and it started at zero because that was our default, but we could also do two to five. Let's run this. And now we go position zero, one, and then we started to L L. Now we can also multiply strings and we have this a hello world. So we can do a times three. If we run this, it'll give us hello world three times. And we can also do a plus a.",

    "text": "And that is hello world, hello world. Now let's go down here and take a look at lists. List are really fantastic because they store multiple values. The string was stored as one value multiple characters, but a list can store multiple separate values. So let's create our very first list. We'll say list really quickly. And then we'll put a bracket and a bracket means this is going to be a list. There are other ones like a squiggly bracket and a parentheses. These denote that they are different types of data types. The bracket is what makes a list a list. So to keep it super simple, we'll say one, two, three, and we'll run this. And now we have a list that has three separate values in it. The comma in our list denotes that they are separate values. And a list is indexed just like a string is indexed. So position zero is this one position one is the two and position two is the three. Now when we made this list, we didn't have to use any quotes because these are numbers. But if we wanted to create a list and we wanted to add string values, we have to do it with our quotes. So we'll say quote cookie dough. Then we'll do a comma to separate the value. And then we'll say strawberry. And then we'll do one more. And this will just be chocolate. And when we run this, we have all three of these values stored in our list. Now one of the best things about list is you can have any data type within them. They don't just have to be numbers or strings. You can basically put anything you want in there. So let's create a new list. And let's say vanilla. And then we'll do three. And then we'll add a list within a list and we'll say scoops. I'm a spoon and then we'll get out of that list. And then we'll add another value of true for Boolean. And now we can hit shift enter and we just created a list with several different data types within one list. Now let's take this one list right here with all of our different ice cream flavors. We'll say ice underscore cream is equal to this list. Now one thing that's really great about lists is that they are changeable. That means we can change the data in here. We can also add and remove items from the list after we've already created it. So let's go and take ice cream and we'll say ice cream dot append. And this is going to append it to the very end of the list. Do an open parentheses. Let's say salted caramel. Now when we run this and we call it just like this, it's going to take this list, add salted caramel to the end and we'll print it off. And as you can see, it was added to the list. And just like I said before, let me go down here, we can also change things from this list. So let's say ice cream and then we need to look at the indexed position. So we're going to say zero. And that's going to be this cookie dough right here. We can say that is equal to so we can now change that value. So let's call that butter. Be cotton. And now when we call it, we can now see that the cookie dough was changed to butter. Pecan. Another thing that you saw just a little bit ago is something called a list within a list, basically a nested list. So we had scoops spoon true. Let's give this and we'll say nested underscore list is equal to now when we run this, we now have this nested list. So if we look at the index and we say zero, we'll get vanilla. If we say two, we'll get scoops and spoons. Now, since we have a list within a list, we can also look at the index of that nested list. So let's now say one that should give us just spoon and you can go on and on and on with this. You can do lists within lists within lists and all of them will ha",

So we list in a two pull are actually quite similar, but the biggest difference between a list and a two pull is that a two pull is something called immutable. It means it cannot be modified or changed after it's created. Let's go right up here. We're going to say two pull and let's write our very first two pull. So we'll say two pull underscore scoops is equal to and then we'll do an open parentheses. Now these open parentheses, you've seen if you do like a print statement, but that's different because that's executing a function. This is actually creating a two pull, which is going to store data for us. So we'll say one, two, three, two and one. Let's go ahead and create that two pull and we can just check the data type really quickly. And it's a two pull. And just like we saw before, a two pull is also indexed. So if we go at the very first position, which is a one, we will get the output of a one, but we can't do something like append and then add a value like three. If we do that, it's going to say two pull object has no attribute append. It's just because you cannot change or add anything to a two pull, just like we were talking about before. Typically, people will use two pulls for when data is never going to change. An example for this might be something like a city name,",

    "text": "a country, a location, something that won't change. They definitely have their use cases, but I don't think they're as popular as just using a list. So now let's scroll down and start taking a look at sets, but really quickly, let me add a few more cells for us. And let's say sets. Now, a set is somewhat similar to a list and a two pull, but they are a little bit different. In fact, that they don't have any duplicate elements. Another big difference is that the values within a set cannot be accessed using an index because it doesn't have an index because it's actually unordered. We can still loop through the items in a set with something like a for loop, but we can't access it using the bracket and then accessing its index point. So let's go ahead and create our very first set. So we're going to say daily underscore points. Then we're going to say equal to create a set. We're going to use these squiggly brackets. I don't know if there's an actual name for those. If I'm being honest, I call them squiggly brackets. And that's what we're going to go with. We're going to put in a one, a two, and a three. So let's go ahead and run this. And let's look at the type. And as you can see, it is a set. Now, when we print this out, it's going to show us one, a two, and a three. And those are all the values within our set. But if we copy this and we'll say daily pints log, this is going to be every single day. Maybe I had different values. Now when we run this and we do the exact same thing, now when we print this, it's going to have just the unique values within that set. Now a use case for set, and this is something that I've done in the past, is comparing two separate sets. Maybe you have a list or a tuple, and you convert that into a set, and that will narrow it down to its unique values. Then you can compare the unique values of one set to the unique values in another set. And then we can see what's the same and what's different. So let's go down here and let's say, wife's underscore daily, and we'll just copy this right here. We'll say is equal to Stuart's squiggly lines. Let's do one, two, just random numbers. So now this is my daily log, and this is my wife's daily log. And now we can compare these values. So let's go right down here. Let's say print, we'll do my daily logs, and then we'll do this bar right here. And this is going to show us the combined unique values. It's basically like putting them all in one set, and then trimming it down to just the unique values. So we'll take wife's daily pines log. And when we run this, we actually need to run this first. When we run this, we should see all the unique values between these two sets. And so as you can see, zero, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, twenty four, thirty, one. So these are all the unique values between these two sets. We can also do another one. And instead of this bar, we're going to do this symbol right here, which I believe is called an ampersand. Don't quote me on that. But when we run this, it's going to show what matches. That means which ones show up in both sets. So the only ones that show up in both sets are one, two, three, and five. We can also do the opposite of that by doing a minus sign. And this is going to show us what doesn't match. And so we have four, six, and thirty one. Now, where is our twenty four that was in our wife's daily pints long? It's in this one, but we're subtracting the values on this one. So let's reverse this and we'll say daily pints log. And let's run it. Now, those are our other values. So we're taking the values of this and they were subtracting all the ones that are the same and getting the remaining",

So let's run this. So these values are completely unique only to each of those sets. Now, the very last one that we're going to look at in this video is dictionaries. So let's go right down here. That's out a few cells and let's say dictionaries. Now, I saved dictionary for last because this one is probably the most different out of all the previous data types that we've looked at. Within a data type, we have something called a key value pair. That means when we use a dictionary, it's not like a list where you just have a value comma value comma value. We have a key that indicates what that value is attributed to. So let's write out a dictionary to see how this looks. We're going to say dictionary underscore cream. And just like a set, we use a squiggly line. But the thing that differentiates it is that in a dictionary, we'll have that key value pair. Whereas in a set, each value is just separated by a comma. So let's write name and this is our key. And then we do a colon and this is then where we input our value. So we're going to say Alex, free bird. And then we separate that key value pair by a comma. And now we can do another key value pair. So we'll say weekly intake and a colon. And we'll say five pints of ice cream, the comma. And then we'll do favorite ice creams. And now what we're going to do is we're going to put in here a list. So within this dictionary, we can also add a list. We'll do MCC from mint chocolate chip. And then we'll add chocolate, another one of my favorites. So now we have our very first dictionary. It's copy this and run it. And let's just look at the type. And as you can see, it says that this is a dictionary. Let's also print it out. Now if we want to, we can take our dictionary cream and say dot values with an open parentheses. When we execute this, we'll see all of the values within this dictionary. So here's our values of Alex freeberg, five mint chocolate chip and chocolate. We can also say keys. And when we run this, all of the keys, the name, weekly intake and favorite ice creams. And we can also say items. So this key value pair is one item and this key value pair is another item. Now one difference between something like a list and a dictionary is how you call the index. But you can't call it by doing something like this where you just do a bracket. Oops, and say zero. So this would in theory take this very first one, right? Our very first key value pair. That's going to give us an error. How you call a dictionary is actually by the key. So it doesn't technically have an index, but you can't specify what you want to call and take it out. So we're going to say name and this is going to call that key right here. And when we run this, we'll get the value, which is Alex freeberg. One other thing that you can do is you can also update information and a dictionary, which we can't with some other data types. So for this, for the name, it was Alex freeberg. Now let's say, steen freeberg. And when we update that, I'm also going to print the dictionary. It wrote this. So it's going to update Christine freeberg in that value of the name. So let's go ahead and run this. And now it changed the name from Alex freeberg to Christine freeberg. We can also update all of these values at one time. So let's copy this. And I'm going to put it right down here. I'm going to say dictionary dot cream dot update. Then we're going to put a rocket or not a bracket, but a parentheses around these. So now what we're going to do is update this entire thing. Let me take this, say rent this dictionary. Now we can update this to anything we want. So instead of here, I can say, I'll say wait. And because of all that ice cream, I now weigh 300 pounds. So let's run this. And as you can see, it did not delete our key value pair right here. Instead, it just added to it. When you're using the update, we can't actually delete that's the delete statement. And I'll show you that in just a second. But all we did was added this new value. It also is going to check and see if you changed anything with your key value pair. So we can go in here and change this value and we'll say 10. So now when we run this, the value of this key value pair was changed. But let's say we do want to delete it. We'll say DEL that stands for delete part of this dictionary cream. And now let's specify the key, which will also delete the value with it. Well, let's specify the key that we want to get rid of. And let's say wait. And t",

    "text": "Hello everybody. Today we're going to be taking a look at comparison, logical, and membership operators in Python. Operators are used to perform operations on variables and values. For example, you're often going to want to compare two separate values to see if they are the same or if they're different within Python and that's where the comparison operator comes in. Right here, you can see our operators. You can also see what they do. So this equal sign, equal sign, stands for equal. We have the does not equal, the greater than, less than, greater than or equal to, and less than or equal to. And honestly, I use these almost every single time I use Python. So these are very important to know and know how to use. So let's get rid of that really quickly and actually start writing it out and see how these comparison operators work in Python. The very first one that we're going to look at is equal to now. You can't just say 10 is equal to 10. Let's try running that really quickly by clicking shift enter. It's going to say, cannot assign to literal. That's because this is like assigning a variable. We're trying to say 10 is equal to 10 and then we can call that 10 later. But that's not how this actually works. What we're trying to do is to determine whether 10 is equal to 10. So we're going to say equal sign equal sign. And then if we run that by clicking shift enter again, it's going to say true. Now if we put something else like 50 in there and we try to run this, it's going to say false. So really what you're going to get when you use these comparison operators is either a true or a false. If we take this right down here, we can also say does not equal and we're going to use an exclamation point equal sign. And that says 10 is not equal to 50 and that should be true. You can also compare strings and variables. So let's go right down here and we're going to say vanilla is not equal to chocolate. And when we run this, it'll say false. Now if it was the same, just like when we did our numbers, it should say true. And we can also compare variables. So we'll say X is equal to vanilla and Y is equal to chocolate. And then when we come down here, we can say X is equal to Y and it'll give us a false and we say X is not equal to Y and it'll give us a true. The next one that we're going to take a look at is the less than. So let's copy this one right up here. Let's scroll down and let's say 10 is less than 50. Now this will come out as true. Now let's say we put a 10 in here. Before 10 was of course less than 50, but is 10 less than 10? No, that's false because they are the same. So if we want an output that is true, all we would have to add is an equal sign right here. And this would say 10 is less than or it is equal to 10. And now it's true. Of course, we can say the",

    "text": "exact same thing by saying greater than. So 10 is equal or greater than 10. That'll be true because 10 is equal to 10. We can also say 50 is greater or equal to 10 because 50 is obviously greater than 10. Now let's look at logical operators that are often combined with comparison operators. So our operators are and or and not. So if you have an and that returns true if both statements are true, if it's or only one of the statements has to be true and the not basically reverses the result. So if it was going to return true, it would return false. I don't use this not one a lot, but I will show you how it works. So let's actually test that out. So before we were saying 10 is greater than 50. And of course, this returned false. So now let's add a parentheses around this 10 is greater than 50. And we're going to say and we'll do an open parentheses 50 is greater than 10. Now this statement right here is true. 50 is greater than 10. So we have a true statement and a false statement. But this and is going to look at both of them. It's going to say they both need to be true in order to return a true. So let's try running this. And we still have a false. If we wanted to return true, we're going to have to change this to make it a true statement. So 70 is greater than 50 and 50 is greater than 10. When we run this, it should return true. Now let's look at the or so let's copy this and we'll say 10 is greater than 50 or 50 is greater than 10. Now this is a false statement and this is a true statement. So if even one of them is a true statement, the output should be true. And again, we can do this even with strings. So we can do vanilla and chocolate. There we go. And vanilla is actually greater than chocolate because V is a higher number in the alphabetical order. So V is like 20 something whereas chocolate is three. Right. So it actually looks at the spelling for this. So if we say or here, it will come out true. And if we say and here, it should also be true because V is greater than C and 50 is greater than 10. So this should also be true. Now let's copy this right here. And we're go",

So instead of returning true, it's going to return false. So now let's take a look at membership operators and we use this to check if something, whether it's a value or a string or something like that is within another value or string or sequence. Our operators are in and not in. So it's pretty simple. If it's in, it's going to return true. If the sequence where they specified value is present in the object, just like we were talking about. And for not in, it's basically the exact same thing if it's not in that object. So let's start out by taking a look at a string. We're going to say ice underscore cream is equal to I love chocolate ice cream. And then we're going to say love in ice underscore cream. And that will turn true. So all we're doing is searching if the word love or that string is in this larger string. We could also just do that by literally copying this and putting this where this is. We can check is this string part of this string. And it'll say true. We can also make a list. So we'll say scoops is equal to and then we'll do a bracket. We'll say one, two, three, four, five. And then we'll say two in scoops. So all we're doing is searching to see if two is within this list. And that should return true. Now if we put a six here and we said not in, it will also return true because six is not in scoops. And that is true. And just like we did, we could also say wanted underscore scoops and we'll say eight. So I wanted eight scoops. So we can say wanted scoops in scoops. And this should return true because there's not an",

So let's try this one. It should be LF 3 and this one ran properly. Now within our condition so far, we've only used a comparison operator. We can also use a logical operator like and or. So we can say if 25 is less than 10, which it's not, let's say or actually, and we'll say or one is less than three. Which is true. If we run this now it will actually work.

The for loop is used to iterate over a sequence, which could be a list, a tuple, an array, a string, or even a dictionary. Here's the list that we'll be working with throughout this video. And I have this little diagram right here, which kind of explains how a for loop works. The for loop is going to start by looking at the very first item in our sequence or our list. And that's going to be our one right here. It's going to ask, is this the last element in our list? And it is not. So it's going to go down to this body of the for loop. Now we can have a thousand different things that can happen in the body of the for loop as we're out to look at in just a second. Then it's going to go up to the next element and ask, is this the last element reached? So it'll be no again, because we're going to the two. And then the three and then the four and the five. Once it reaches the five, it'll go to the body of the for loop. And then when it asks if that's the last element, the answer would be yes, because it's iterat",

Now that may not have made perfect sense, but let's actually start writing out the syntax of a for loop so we can understand this better. To start our for loop, we're going to save for. And then we're going to give it a temporary variable for this for loop. So it's a variable as it iterates through these numbers. It's going to assign the variable to that number. So for this one, we're just going to say number because it's pretty appropriate. These are all numbers. And then we're going to say in integers. Now right here, you can put just about anything. This could be the list. This could be a tuple. This could be a string even. But that is what we're going to iterate through. So we're saying for the variables, each of these numbers within this list of integers. And then we're going to write a colon. This is the body of code that's going to actually be executed when we run through and iterate through our list. So for our first example, we're going to start off super simple. And all we're going to do is say print open parentheses and say number as it iterates through the one, two, three, four, and five. Number becomes our variable that is going to be printed. So during that first loop, our one will be printed because that will be assigned right here. And then through the next iteration, the two will be assigned and will be put right here in each loop until the very end. So let's hit shift enter. And as you can see, it did exactly that. Now in this body and I'll copy and paste this down here. In this body, we really can do just about anything we want. We don't even have to use this variable number right here. We can just print, yep, if we wanted to. And what it's going to do is for each",

When it loops through that one, it's doing one plus one. When it loops through the two, it's doing two plus two. That is basically how a four loop works. Now for a dictionary, it's going to handle it a little bit differently. So let's create a dictionary really quickly. So we'll say ice, cream, dictionary is equal to, we're going to do a squiggly brackets. So we're going to say name and we're going to say colon. We need to assign our value for that item. So we're going to say Alex Breberg. We'll do our next one separated by a comma and we'll say weekly intake. And I'll say five scoops per week. The next one we will do is favorite ice creams. And for this one, we're going to do something a little bit different. For this, we're going to have a list within this dictionary. So we'll say within our list of my favorite ice creams, we'll say mint chocolate chip. And I'll just do MCC for that. And we'll separate that out by a comma and we'll say chocolate. So now we have this dictionary ice cream dict. And within it, we have my name, my weekly intake, and my favorite ice creams with a list in there as well. Let's hit shift enter. And now we're going to start writing our for loop. Now the for loop is going to look very similar. But to call a dictionary, it's just a little bit different. So we're going to say for the cream in ice underscore cream underscore dictionary dot values. And then we're going to do parentheses and then a colon. Now we're going to print the cream. So in order to indicate what we actually want to pull, we have to specify within the dictionary what we want. Are we pulling the item? Are we pulling the value? We need to specify this. So that's why we have this dot values right here. So let's run this and see what we get. So as you can see, we are pulling in the values right here. That's why we're pulling an Alex freeberg five and mint chocolate chip slash chocolate. Now we are able to call both of those both the key and the value. So let's go right down here and we can do both the key and the value. So we can pull two things at one time. And we're going to do this by saying dot items. So we could also do dot key if we just wanted to do a key, but we want to do items. We're going to do both of them. So we're going to go right down here and say for key and value in ice cream dictionary dot items print. And let's write key and then we'll do a comma. And then let's give it a little arrow or something like that, something like this. And then we'll do a comma and we'll say value. And let's print this off and see what we get. So",

So now let's talk about nested for loops. We've looked at for loops. We understand how they work and why they do what they do. But what about a nested for loop a for loop within a for loop for this example. Let's create two separate lists. Let's create flavors and let's make that a list by making it a bracket. We'll do vanilla, the classic chocolate. And then cookie dough all great flavors. So that's our first list and then we're going to say toppings. And we'll do a bracket for that as well. And we'll say that Fudge. And then we'll do Oreos. And then we'll do Marsh. Melos say spell marshmallows. It's an E. That looks wrong. I might be spelling it wrong, but that's okay. So let's save this by clicking shift enter. And now we have our flavors and our toppings. So now let's write our first for loops. We're going to say for one is in our number one for loop. We're going to say in flavors and we'll do a colon. We'll click enter. Now we can write our second for loop. So we're going to say for two in toppings. And we'll do a colon and enter. And then we're going to say print and we'll do an open parentheses. And then we're going to say one. So we're printing the one in flavors. And then we'll say one comma. We'll say topped with comma two. So what this is essentially going to do is we want to say for one. We're going to take the very first one in flavors. And then we're going to loop through all of two as well. So we're going to loop through hot fudge, Oreos and marshmallows. And once we print that off, then we will loop all the way back to flavors and look at the next iteration or the next sequence within the first for loop. So let's run this really quickly and see what we get. So as you can see, it goes vanilla vanilla vanilla. And vanilla is topped with the hot fudge, the Oreos and the marshmallows.

So let's start actually writing out the code and see how this wild loop works. So let's create a variable. We're just going to say number is equal to one. And then we'll say while and now we need to write our condition that needs to be met in order for our block of code beneath this to run. So we're going to say while number is less than five and then we'll do colon enter and now this is our block of code. We're going to say print and then we'll say number. Now what we need to do is basically create a counter. We're going to say number equals number plus one. If you've never done something like this, it's kind of like a counter. Most people start it at zero. In fact, let's start it at zero. And then each time it runs through this wild loop, it's going to add one to this number up here. And then it's going to become a one, a two, a three, each time it iterates through this wild loop. Now once this number is no longer less than five, it'll break out of the wild loop and it will no longer run. So let's run this really quick by hitting shift enter. So it starts at zero. And it's going to say while the number is less than five, print number. So the first time that it runs through, it is zero. And so it prints zero and then it adds one to number. And then it continues that wild loop right here and it keeps looping through this portion. It never goes back up here to this line of code. This is just our variable that we start wi",

And what we're going to say is if number is equal to three, we're going to break. Now with the break statement, we can basically stop the loop even if the wild condition is true. So while this number is less than five, it's going to continue to loop through. But now we have this break statement. So it's going to say if the number equals three, we're going to break out of this wild loop. But if this is false, we're going to continue adding to that number just like normal.

So we'll go right down here and we'll say else, and we'll do a colon and enter. And then we'll say print and we'll say no longer less than five. Now, because this if statement is still in there, it will break. So let's say six and then we'll run this. And so it's going to iterate through this block of code.

Now, the next thing that I want to look at is the continue statement. If the continue statement is triggered, it basically rejects all remaining statements in the current iteration of the loop. And then we'll go to the next iteration. Now, to demonstrate this, I'm going to change this break into a continue. So before when we had the break, if the number was equal to three, it would stop all the code completely. But when we change this to continue, which we'll do right now, what it's going to do is it's no longer going to run through any of the subsequent code in this block of code, it's just going to go straight up to the beginning and restart our wild loop. So what's going to happen when we run this is it's going to come to three, it's going to become three and it's going to continue back into the wild loop. But it's never going to have that number change to be added to one to continue with the wild loop. This will basically create an infinite loop. Let's try this really quickly. And as you can see, it's going to stay three forever. Eventually, this would time out, but I'm just going to stop the code really quick. So if we just change up the order of which we're doing things, we're going to say, there, and we're going to put this down here. So what it's going to do now, instead of printing the number immediately, and then adding the number later, we're going to add the number right away. And then we're going to say, if it is three, we're going to continue, and it's going to print the number. So let's try executing this and",

But now let's take it up a notch and start looking at arguments. So let's go right down here. And we're going to say define number underscore squared. We'll do a parentheses and our colon as well. Now really quickly when you're naming your function, it's kind of like naming a variable. You can use something like X or Y, but I tend to like to be a little bit more descriptive. But now let's take a look at passing an argument into a function. The argument is going to be passed right here in the parentheses. So for us, I'm just going to call it a number. And then we're going to hit enter and now we'll write our body of code. And all we're going to do for this is type print, open parentheses, and we'll say number. And we'll do two stars.

    "text": "t thing to mention is if you have two arguments within your function and you're calling it right here, you have to pass in two arguments. You can't just have one. So if we have a five right here, it's going to error out. We have to specify both arguments or it to work. Now let's take a look at arbitrary arguments. Now, arbitrary arguments are really interesting because if you don't know how many arguments you want to pass through, if you don't know if it's a one, a two or a three, you can specify that later when you're calling the argument. So you don't have to do it up front and know that information ahead of time. So let's define our function. So we're going to say define and then we're going to say number underscore args and we'll do an open parentheses and a colon. Now within our argument right here, typically we would just specify here's what our argument will be. It will be number or it will be a word, right? But what we're going to do is something called an arbitrary argument. So it's unknown. So we're going to put star and we'll say args. Now you will see something exactly like this. Typically, if you're looking at tutorials, they'll have star args in there or if you're looking at just a generic piece of code, this is what it will look like. But for us, we're going to actually put number. So again, we have the star and then we have our arbitrary argument right here. And then we'll hit enter and we're going to say print open parentheses. And this is where it's going to get a little bit different. So we're going to say number and then we're going to do an open bracket and let's say zero. And then we'll do that times and then we'll say number again with a bracket of one. So in a little bit once we run this and then we call this number args function right here, we're going to need to specify the number zero and the number one that's going to be called. So let's go ahead and run this and then we are going to call it. And let's say five comma six comma one two eight. So right up here, we did not know how many arguments we were going to pass through. It could be five. It could be a thousand. And we could also call in a tuple. And that's what this is right here. We're calling in a tuple. So what it's going to do now is when it calls this number, it's going to call the very first within that tuple, which will be that five. And then it'll also call in this number, which will be the first position, which is the six. So let's hit shift enter and it's going to multiply these numbers together. So five times six is equal to 30. Now, like I just said, this is a tuple. So we don't actually have to write out these numbers like we just did. We can pass through a tuple when we are actually calling this function. Let's do that right up here. Let's just create, let's call it args underscore tuple and we'll do open parentheses and we'll do the same numbers. Let's just copy it. It's make it easier. And now we've created this tuple right here, which we can then pass in. And this is a lot more handy, a lot more specific. And this is most likely how someone would do something like this. But let's now create this. And now we can copy args tuple and pass it through. Now, really quickly, this is going to fail. And I'm doing that on purpose, but I want to show you what you need to do in order to pass through this tuple. So right now it's go",

Now the last two things that we're going to look at are keyword arguments and arbitrary keyword arguments. There are more things that you can learn and do within functions. But again, I'm just trying to teach you the basics to make sure that you understand how they work. So let's go right up here and a keyword argument is kind of similar to this right here. And let's actually copy this and put it right down here. Now a keyword argument is very similar in that you're going to specify your arguments right here. But what we did up here, let me bring this down. When we actually called the function, what we did was we just put in a five and a three. And when we did that, it automatically assigned number to five and power to three. And that's totally fine and you can do that. But if you want a little bit more control, you can use a keyword argument. So right here, we could say, power is equal to five and number is equal to three. So I just switched it around, right? Number was assigned to five and power was assigned to three. But I just switched it to show you how th",

Again, it just gives you a little bit more control. You don't have to put them in specific positions like if you're just calling multiple arguments. Now let's come right down here. We're going to create basically another custom function. So for this one, we're going to write define number underscore org. And then we'll do an open parentheses, a colon and enter. And what this one is, is this one is a keyword argument or an arbitrary keyword argument. Now to specify an arbitrary argument, all we did was a star. And then we input number. But if we're doing a keyword argument, we actually have to have two stars right here. So let's start taking a look. And again, if you're doing arbitrary, it means we don't really know how many keyword arguments we want to pass into our function. So we're just going to put star star number and then later within our body of code. And when we're calling it, we'll be able to specify it. And just like the arbitrary argument before, the arbitrary keyword argument means we really just don't know how many keyword arguments we're going to need to pass into our function. So to demonstrate this, let's write print, do an open parentheses. And we'll say, my, oops, you do an apostrophe. My number is, we'll do, just like that. We'll space and we'll say plus. And this is kind of where it gets a little interesting or a little bit more tricky. So we're going to say is number. So this is us calling our number. And then we're going to do a bracket. And then I'm actually going to go to calling the function. It's a little bit backward or a little bit different than what you might think. But when we're calling it, what I'm going to do is I'm going to say, integer is equal to, let's just do some random number. Now, when we're calling that keyword within our body of code, what we're going to do is we're going to actually type out integer just like this. And this looks a little bit different. But what this allows us to do is we can put as many keyword arguments in here as we want later. And I'll show you in just a second. But for us, we're just creating this key and this value when we are calling it within the function. So now when we create this and we run this, oh, whoops, I forgot. This has to be a string. So let's run this again. Now we'll say my number is two, three, zero nine. Then we're going to add, we'll say plus, and this isn't going to look great. We'll say my other number, because this will all be in the same line. That's okay. My other number and then we'll say number. And we can specify again, what we want in there. So now we can go down here to where we're calling it. We'll put it comma and we'll say integer, integer two is equal to do a random number. And then we'll put integer two right here. And then we'll add us right here so we don't error out. We'll create this. We'll run this. And as you can see, both numbers were passed through. Again, this is not as terrible. But now you can see that you have this arbitrary keyword argument right here. And all we have to do is put number number. And we can pass through as many of these arbitrary ke",

Now we can also convert a list into a set, but it may change the actual values within it. And let's check that out really quickly. So let's say we have this list and let's add a few more values to this. Just like that. Now let's say we want to convert it to a set. So we're going to run this and we'll say set of list underscore type. And let's try running this and see what the output is. So this is something that you really need to be aware of when you are converting data types, because set does not act the same as a list. A set is basically going to take the unique values in the list and convert it to a set. And it fundamentally",

Now let's go down here and take a look at dictionaries. Now let's say we have a dictionary called dictionary underscore type. And we'll do a squiggly bracket and we'll say name and we'll do a colon. I will say Alex, then we'll do age and a colon and we'll say 28. And then we'll do here. All in. And so really quickly, let's take that dictionary type and just confirm that it is a dictionary. And it is. And now we're going to do is take a look at all of the items within that dictionary. So we're going to do dictionary type dot items, open parentheses. And this is going to show us all the items within it. Now we can also take this and look at something like the values. And when we run that, these are our values. So within our dictionary, we have items and that's what this is right here. This is one item. And then within that, we have our values, which are right here. So Alex 28 and NA. And then we have something called a key. And this is the key. The name, age and hair are all keys. And we can look at that by saying dot ease. So let's say we want to take all of the keys and put that into a list. What we're going to do is we're going to take this right here, say list. We'll do an open parentheses. We'll type that in right there. So it says a list and we're converting these keys into a list. And let's run that. And now this is a list. And let's just check the type as well, just to confirm.

    "text": "What's going on everybody? Welcome back to another video. Today we're going to be starting our Python web scraping tutorial series. Now this is more of a continuation of the Python tutorial series, but because we're going to be focusing on web scraping for three or four videos, I wanted to just make it its own little mini series. In this series I'm going to show you the basics of web scraping, how to actually look at HTML, how to inspect a web page, how to pull that data in and then even put it into a CSV file so you can save it and use it. Now in this series we're just covering the basics, which is a fantastic place to start, but in future series, I'll be going into something more advanced web scraping topics as well. So without further ado, let's jump on my screen and get started with web scraping. Now the first thing that we need to learn is HTML. HTML stands for hypertext markup language and it's used to describe all of the elements on a web page. Now when we actually go to a website and start pulling data and information, we need to know HTML so you can specify exactly what we want to take off of that website. So that's where HTML comes in. And we're going to look at the basics, understanding just the basic structure of HTML, then we'll go look at a real website and you'll kind of see that's a little bit more difficult than what we just have right here, but this is the basic building blocks to get to what the HTML actually looks like on a website. Now this is basically what HTML looks like. We have these angle brackets with things like HTML, head, title, body, and then you'll notice that at the end, we'll have a body and then we'll have a body at the bottom. This forward slash body denotes that this is the end of the body section in HTML. So everything inside of this is within this body. So there is this hierarchy within HTML. We have HTML and HTML at the bottom, which encapsulates all the HTML on the website. Then we have things like head and head, body and body. Now within these sections, we usually have things like classes, tags, attributes, text and all these other things, things that we'll get to in different lessons. But one of the easiest ones to notice and look at are tags, things like a p tag or a title tag. Now within these tags, because this is a super simple example, we have these strings here, my first web page, and this is what's called a variable string, and this is actual text that we could take out of this web page. Now that you understand the super basics of HTML, let's actually go to our website and I'm going to have a link down below, but it's going to be this one right here. This is basically just a website that you can, you know, practice web scraping on. It's called scrape this site.com. And what we're going to do is look at the HTML behind this web page and you can do this on any website that you go on. So we're going to right click, we're going to go down to inspect. Now right off the bat, this looks a lot more complicated and a lot more complex than the very simple illustration that we're looking at. But let's kind of roll this up just a little bit. You'll notice we have HTML and HTML at the bottom. We have a head, and there is the end of the head and the body and the end of the body. So in a super simple sense, it is similar, but just the information that's within it is a lot more difficult. Now if we look at this title right here, this is our title tag. If we click this little arrow, this is our drop down, you'll notice that here we have the string hockey teams forms searching and pagination. Now let's say we didn't know we didn't want to click on that and you'll find it. There's something that's super helpful within this inspection page that you can click on right here. It says select an element in the page to inspect it. So we're going to click on that. And as we go through our page and let's click on this title, it's going to take us to exactly where this is in our HTML. This is extremely helpful, extremely useful. For example, let's say the data I want is down here. I want to take in the Boston Bruins. I can click on it. And it's going to take me to where that is exactly in the HTML. This is where we can start writing our web scraping script to specify, okay, I'm looking for a TR tag. I'm looking for a TD tag. I'm looking for the class called team. This is all information and things that we can use to specify exactly what we want to pull out of our webpage. Now there are other things that we didn't really look at as well and just our simple illustration. Let's come right over here. There's things like H refs. Now these are hyperlinks. So if we went and then clicked on this, this is just regular text, but inside of it is this hyperlink. Where if we clicked on it, it would take us to another website. And typically that's denoted by this H ref right here. Then you'll typically see things like a P tag, which usually stands for a paragraph. Now the last thing that I want to show you while we're here and we're going to learn a lot more in the next several lessons. But if we come right down here, there is this actual entire table here. And let's try to find this table. And I'm having trouble selecting the entire thing, but let's select this team name. And if we look a",

And if we look at this team name, you can see that this is encapsulating the table. So this table tag. Now these are super helpful because it takes in the entire table. Now if we wrap this up and we look just at this, it says class table. And then we have the end of this table tag. Now when we open it, it's going to have all of this information. So as you can see, as I'm highlighting over it, we have these T h tags. Then we have these TD tags and even these TR tags, which is the individual data. And this is something that we'll look at when we're actually scraping all of the data from this table in a future lesson. So this is how we can use HTML. How we can inspect the web page and see exactly what's going on kind of under the hood. And then in future lessons, we'll see how we can use this HTML to specify exactly what data we want to pull out. Thank you guys so much for watching.

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at beautiful soup and requests. Now these packages and Python are really useful. These are the two main ones that I use and I was first starting out with web scraping. It can get a lot of what you want done in order to get that information out. Now of course, there are other packages that you can use that may be a little bit more advanced, but again, this is just the beginner series and a future series will look at other packages as well that have some more advanced functionality. So what we're going to be doing is run import these packages and then we're going to get all of the HTML from our website and make sure that it's in a usable state. And then in the next lesson, we're going to kind of query around in the HTML kind of pick and choose exactly what we want. We'll look at things like tags, variable strings, classes, attributes and more. So let's get started by importing our packages. What we're going to say is from BS4. This is the module that we're taking it from. We're going to say import and then we'll do beautiful soup. Then we're going to come down and we're going to say import requests. Now let's go ahead and run this. I'm going to hit shift enter and it works well for me. Now if this does not work for you, you may potentially need to actually install BS4. So you may have to go to your terminal window and say pip install BS4. I'll just let you Google how to do that if you need to. X is pretty easy, but if you're using Jupyter notebooks through anaconda, like how we set it up at the beginning of this Python series, then you should be totally fine. It should be there for you. The next thing that we need to do is specify where we're taking this HTML from. So what we need to actually do is come right over here to our web page and we need to get the URL. So we're going to go here. We're going to copy this URL and I'm just going to put it right here for a second. And what we're going to do is we're going to using this URL quite a bit. So we just want to assign it to a variable. So to say URL is equal to and then we'll put it right in here. Now we can get rid of that. So now this is our URL going forward. This is where we will be pulling data from. Let's go ahead and run this. Now we're going to use requests. And what we're going to do is we're going to say requests that get and then we're going to put in URL. Now this get function is going to use the request library. It's going to send a get request to that URL and it's going to return a response object. Let's go ahead and run this. As you can see here I got a response of 200. If you got something like a 204 or a 400 or 401 or 404, all of these things are potentially bad. Something like a 204 would mean there was no content in the actual web page. 400 means a bad request. So it was invalid. The server couldn't process it and you don't get any response. If you got a 404 that might be one that you're familiar with. That's an error that means the server cannot be found. The next thing that we're going to do is take the HTML. Now if you remember we come right back here and we inspect this we have all of this HTML right here. Now in this web page specifically right now it's completely static because it's not a bunch of moving stuff or anything like that. Usually when you're looking at HTML if you're looking at something like Amazon and those web pages can update but when you actually pull that into Python you're basically getting a snapshot of the HTML at that time. So what we're going to do is bring in all of this HTML which is our snapshot of our website and then we can take a look at it. So we're going to come right down here and now we're going to say beautiful soup. So now we'll use the beautiful soup package or libraries when you say beautiful soup. We're going to do an open parentheses. We're going to do two things. There's two parameters that we need to put in here. First we need to put in this get request. We actually need to name this and we'll call this page. We'll say pages equal to and let's run this. And now we're going to put that page in here and what we're going to say is dot text. So the page is what's sending that request and then the dot text is what's retrieving the actual raw HTML that we're going to be using. Then we're going to put a comma here and what we need to specify is how we're going to parse this information. Now this is an HTML. So what we're going to do is HTML just like this. This is a standard that's already built into this library. So we don't need to go any further, but it's basically going to parse the information in an HTML format. Let's go ahead and run this. Let's see what we get. And as you can see, we have a lot of information. And as we scroll down, I'll try to point out some things that we've already looked at in previous lessons. Something like this T H tag. That should be very similar. That's the title. Then we have these TD tags. And then of course, if we scroll down even further, we'll have things like a TR tag. So these are all things that we looked at in that first lesson when learning about HTML. Now again, we want to assign this to a variable. So we're going to say soup. That's going to say equal to this information right here. Now I'm not going to go into all the history behind beautiful soup. But what I will say is the guy who created this beautiful soup library. What he said was is that it takes this really",

What he said was is that it takes this really messy HTML or XML, which you can also use it for. And it makes it into this kind of beautiful soup. So I just thought that was kind of funny. But that's why we're calling it soup right here. And we're going to go ahead and run this. And we'll come right down here. And we'll say print soup. And let's run it. And now we have everything in here. So we have our HTML, our head. We have some href and some links in here. Let's scroll down a little bit more. And then we have our body right there. And of course, we have a bunch of information here. Now in the next lesson, what we're going to be doing is learning how to kind of query all of this to take specific information out and basically understand a lot of what's going on in this HTML to make sure we can actually get what we need. Now if this looks really kind of messy to you and it just doesn't make a lot of sense, there is one more thing that I'm going to show you. And we'll come right down here. So we'll say soup. Predify. And if you've ever used a different type of programming languages, purify is very common in a lot of them. We'll just make it a little bit more easy to visualize and see. You'll notice that it kind of has this hierarchy built in. Whereas if we scroll up, there's no hierarchy built in. It's all just down this left hand side. So if you kind of want to view it and just kind of visually see the differences, this does help a lot. But it doesn't actually help a lot when you're querying it or using, you know, find and find all, which is what we're going to look at in the next lesson. So that is our lesson on beautiful soup and requests. In the next two lessons, we're going to be looking at find and find all as well as really diving into things like variable strings and tags and costs and all those things. And then in the last lesson, we're going to do kind of this mini project where we try to get all the data from this web page that we've been using from that table and put it into a panda's data frame.

    "text": "Hello everybody, in this lesson, we're going to be taking a look at Find and Find all. Really, we're going to be looking at a ton of different things in this lesson. This is where we really start digging in, seeing how we can extract specific information from our web page. But in order to do that, let's set everything up where we actually bring in the HTML, like we did in the last lesson. And we're just going to write all this out one more time, just to practice if nothing else. And then we'll get into actually getting that information from the HTML. So we're going to start by saying from VS 4 import, beautiful soup. There we go. And import requests. We'll go ahead and run this. Then we're going to come up here, grab our HTML or sorry, our URLs. We'll say URL is equal to and we'll have that right here. Now we need to say page is equal to and then we'll do requests dot get and then we'll put in our URL right here. And we're going to come over here and run this. And lastly, we need to say soup. We'll say soup is equal to you, the full soup. There we go. And then within our parentheses, we need to specify the page dot text because we need that in our parser, which is HTML. And there we go. And let's go ahead and run this. Let's print it out. Make sure it's working. And there we go. So we have our soup right here. All this should look really similar to our last lesson. And so now we've brought in our HTML from our page. We have a lot, a lot of information in here. Now really quickly, let's come over and let's inspect our web page. Now in here, we have a ton of information. Right. We have a bunch of different tags and classes and all these other things. But how do we actually use these? Well, that's where the find and find all is going to come into play. And they're pretty similar and you'll see that in just a little bit. But let's say we want to take one of these tags and let's come down. Let's say we just want to take this div tag. Now there's going to be a lot of different div tags in our HTML. But let's just come right here. Let's go down and let's say we're going to call soup or say soup. That's all of our information. We're going to say dot find. Now within our parentheses, we can specify a lot of different things. But we're going to keep it really simple right now. We're just going to say di v. Let's go ahead and run this. What this is going to bring up is the very first div tag in our HTML. And that's going to be this information right here. Now let's copy this. I'm going to do the exact same thing except we're going to say find underscore all. Now let's run this. Now we're going to have a ton more information. Really all find and find all do is that they find the information. Now find is only going to find the first response in our HTML. That's the div class container. Let's go back up to the top. That's our div class container. But find all is going to find all of them. So it'll put it in this list for you. So it's going to have this first one and it goes down to this word slash div, which should be right here. And then we have a comma, which separates our next div tag. So that is how we can use it. Now what if we want to specify one of these div tags? We pulled in a ton of them, but we want to just look for one of them. Well, this is something where the class comes in handy. Because right now we have classes equal to container classes equal to CLMD-12. I don't know what these are. They're off the top of my head. But usually they'll be somewhat unique. And we can use these to help us specify what we're looking for. For example, just kind of glancing of this. We could also use this a tag if we wanted to look at this. So we could say, oh, we're looking for these h refs. So we have an h ref here. And this right down here, we have this h ref as well, which again, if you remember from a previous lesson, that stands for a hyperlink. Now something like the class or the h ref or these IDs, these are all attributes. So we can specify or kind of filter down based off of these. Now let's try it. So what we can do is we can do class first. And this is kind of the default within something like find all is you can even do class on your score. We can come right back up. We have this div. And then here's our class. So again, we have to have the div and the class. If we took this a tag, this is an a tag, which we go right here with the class of something like nav link or something like, but nav link again down here, we need to specify that more. But we have our div. So we'll say clah, coal md 12 right here. And let's go ahead and run this. And now it's going to pull in just that information. Now we're still getting a list because we have multiple of these. So this div class, uh, c",

But we have our div. So we'll say clah, coal md 12 right here. And let's go ahead and run this. And now it's going to pull in just that information. Now we're still getting a list because we have multiple of these. So this div class, uh, coal md 12 doesn't just happen once if we scroll down. We'll see it multiple times something like right here. Uh, or actually, let me see right here. So here's this comma. And here's our next one. So we have two of these, uh, div tags with the class of coal, dash md dash 12. And in each of these, we have different information. This looks like a paragraph with this p tag right here. And let's scroll back up. Uh, so I also think we should try out doing something like this p tag, typically these p tag stand for paragraphs or they have text information in them. Let's try to p tag really quickly. And let's just see what we get. And let's run this. And it looks like we get multiple p tags. Now if we come back here, you can see that there's this information and it's this information that we're pulling in. And I'm just, you know, noticing that from right here. And then we have this information right here. And it looks like there's one more, which is this h ref, which looks like this open source. So data via and then that hyperlink or that link right there. So we have three different p tags. Now just to verify and make sure that that's correct, what we could do is come over here. We're going to click on this paragraph and it's going to take us to that p tag where the class is equal to lead. Come over here and look at this paragraph. Now we have another p tag right over here. Where the class is equal to glyphicon glyphicon slash education. I have no idea what that means. And then we'll go to our last one, which is right here where the p tag is equal to we have a tag h ref class and a bunch of other information. So let's say we just want to pull in this paragraph right here. Let's go here and see how we can specify this information. So it looks like p or the class is equal to lead. That looks like it's going to be unique to just that one. So if we come down here, we're going to say comma and it was class. So you can do class underscore is equal to and then we're going to say lead. Let's try running this and we're just pulling in that information. Now let's say we actually want to pull in this paragraph. We actually want this text right here. And this is a very real use case. You know, let's say I'm trying to pull in some information or a paragraph of text. Well, let's copy this and what we're going to then do is say dot text. And let's run this. Now we're going to get an error right here and this is a very common error because we're trying to use find all. Unfortunately, find all does not have a text attribute. We actually need to change us to find typically when I'm working with these find and find all's I'm using find all most of the time until I want to start extracting text. Then when I specify it, I'll change us back to find just like this. Now let's try this and now we're getting in parentheses. This information now. This is all wonky and needs to definitely be cleaned up a little bit. But if we co back up, it's no longer in a list and we no longer have things like these p tags in here or this class attribute. So we're really just trying to pull out this information. Now, again, this does not look perfect. We could even try to do something like dot strip. Look like there's some white space. That cleans it up a little bit. This definitely looks a little better. And we could definitely go in here and clean this up more. But just for, you know, an example, this is how we can then extract that information. Now let's look at one more example. This is some information. And this is what we're going to do kind of our little mini project in the next lesson on. Let's say we wanted to take all this information. Well, what if we wanted to pull in something like the team name? That's going to be in right here in this TR tag. And each of these TR tags have T",

Well, what if we wanted to pull in something like the team name? That's going to be in right here in this TR tag. And each of these TR tags have TH tags underneath them. So if we scroll down, you'll notice that each row is this TR tag. So let's go ahead and search for let's do TH. Let's just search for that first. So let's come right back up here. Let's use this find all. And we'll get rid of this text for right now. And let's just say we want to look for the TR. Is that what we said we're looking for? No, TH. So let's say we're looking for TH. Let's go ahead and run this. So we're going to have underneath this TH. We have team name, year, winds, losses. And notice these are all the titles. So these titles are the only ones with these TH tags. If we go down, you'll notice that the data is actually TD tags. So now let's go back and look for TD. We'll say D. And this is going to be a lot longer. We have a lot of information. But these are all the rows of data. Let's see if we can just get one piece of this data. We're going to get back. We want just this team name. That's all we're trying to pull in for now. And then we'll try to get this row. And then in the next lesson, we're going to try to get all of this information, make it look really nice. And then we'll put it into a pandas data frame. So let's just get this team name right now. Let's go ahead. We're going to say TH run this and we have this TH. And now that we know we're getting this information in, we can do find. Let's run this. So there's our team name. I'm just going to say .text. And again, we can do .strip just like that. And bam, we have our team name. So you can kind of start getting the idea of how we're pulling this information out. We're really just specifying exactly what we're seeing in this HTML. And what's really, really helpful, you know, it's something that I do all the time is I'm inspecting it and just kind of searching like, what do I want? What piece of information do I want? Then I go ahead and click on it. And then I'm looking, you know, where is this sitting in the hierarchy? It's within the body. It's within this table with the class of table. Then it's down here where this T R tag and then this T D tag. So I'm looking kind of at the hierarchy. And I'm specifying exactly what I'm looking for. So that is what we're going to look at in today's lesson. That's how we can use find and find all. We were able to look at classes and tags and attributes and variable strings, which is this right here, getting that text and variable strings. And we were look at find and find all and how it's pulling that information in and how we can specify exactly what we're looking for. Now in the next lesson, which is definitely going to be the most exciting one, we're going to try to pull in all of this information. So every single thing, because we'll be able to put all this information into a data frame, which then we can use pandas to really search and manipulate that data within that data frame.

Now this will import the pandas library, but it's pretty common place to give it an alias. And as a standard when using pandas, people will say as PD. So this is just a quick alias that you can use. That's what I always use and I've always used it because that's how I learned it. And I want to teach it to you the right way. So that's how we're going to do it in this video. So let's hit shift enter. Now that that is imported, we can start reading in our files. Now right down here, I'm going to open up my file explorer. And we have several different types of files in here. We have CSV files, text files, JSON files, and an Excel worksheet, which is a little bit different than ACSV. So we're going to import all of those. I'm going to show you how it imported as well as some of the different things that you need to be aware of when you",

    "text": "'re importing. So we're going to import some of those different file types. And I'll show you how to do that with in pandas. So the first thing that we need to say is PD. And let's read in a CSV because that's a pretty common one. We'll say read underscore CSV. And this is literally all you have to write in order to call the name. Now it's not going to call it in as a string like it would in one of our previous videos. If you're just using the regular operating system of Python. When you're using pandas, it calls it in as a data frame. And I'll talk about some of the nuances of that. So let's go down to our file explorer. We have this countries of the world CSV. You just need to click on it and right click. And copy as path. And that's literally going to copy that file path for us. You don't have to type it out manually. You can if you'd like. And we're just going to paste it in between these parentheses. Now if we run it right now, it will not work. I'll do that for you. It's saying we have this unicode error. Basically what's happening is it's reading in these backslashes and this colon and all those backslashes in there and this period at the end. What we need to do is read this in as a raw text. So we're just going to say R. And now it's going to read this as a literal string or a literal value. And not as you know, with all these backslashes, which does make a big difference. When we run this, it's going to populate our very first data frame. So let's go ahead and run it. And now we have this CSV in here with our country and our region. Now if we go and pull up this file and let's do that really quickly, let's bring up this country's other world. It automatically populated those headers for us in the data frame. But we don't have any column for those 0, 1, 2, 3. So if we go back, as you can see right here, there's this index. And that's really important in a data frame. It's really what makes a data frame a data frame. And we use index a lot in pandas. We're able to filter on the index, search on the index, and a lot of other things, which I'll show you in future videos. But this is basically how you read in a file. Now if we go right up here in between these parentheses and we hit Shift Tab, this is going to come up for us. Let's hit this plus button. And what this is is these are all the arguments or all the things that we can specify when we're reading in a file. And there are a lot of different options. So let's go ahead and take a look really quickly. Really quickly, I wanted to give a huge shout out to the sponsor of this entire panda series. And that is Yudami. Yudami has some of the best courses at the best prices. And it is no exception when it comes to pandas courses. If you want to master pandas, this is the course that I would recommend. It's going to teach you just about everything you need to know about pandas. So huge shout out to Yudami for sponsoring this panda series. And let's get back to the video. The first thing is obviously the file path. We can specify a separator, which there is no default. So when we're pulling in this CSV, when we're reading in the CSV, it's automatically going to assume it's a comma. So the comma separated file. You can choose delimiters, headers, names, index columns, and a lot of other things, as you can see right here. Now, I will say that I don't use almost any of these. The few that I'm going to show you really quickly in just a second are up the very top. But you can do a ton of different things. And I'm just going to slowly go through them. So that's what those are. You can also go down here. This is our doc string. And you can see exactly how these parameters work. It'll show you and give you a text and walk you through how to do this. Again, most of these you'll probably never use. But things like a separator could actually be useful. And things like a header could be useful because it is possible that you want to either rename your headers or you don't have a header in your CSV. And you don't want it to auto populate that header. So that is something that you can specify. So for example, this header one, and I'll show you how to do this, the default behaviors to infer that there are column names. If no names are passed, this behavior is identical to header equals zero. So it's saying that first row or that first index, which is like right here, that zero is going to be read in as a header. But we can come right over here. And we'll do comma header is equal to. And we can say none. And as you can see, there are no headers now. Instead, it's another index. So we have indexes in both the x-axis and the y-axis. And so right now, we have the zero and one index indicating the first column and the second column. If we want to specify those names, we can say the header equals none. Then we can say names is equal to. And we'll give it a list. And so the first one was entry. And what's that second one? Oh, region. So right here, that's the first row. But we'll rename it and we'll just say country and region. And when we run that, we've now populated the country and the region. We're just pretending that our CSV does not have these values in it. And we have to name it ourselves. That's how you do it. But let's get rid of all that because we actually do want those in there. So we're just going to get rid of those and read it in as normal. And there we go. Now, typically when you're reading in a file, what you need to do is you want to assign that to a variable. Almost always when you see any tutorial or anybody online or even when you're actually working, people will say, df is equal to. df stands for data frame. Again, this is a data frame. And the next video in the series, I'm going to walk through what a series is, as well as what a data frame is because that's pretty important to know when you're working with these data frames. But we'll assign it to this value. And then we'll say, we'll call it by saying df and we'll run it. And that's typically how you'll do things because you want to say this data frame. So later on, you can do things like data frame dot and you can, uh, you know, pass in different modules. But you can't really do that. It's not as easy to do it if you're calling this entire CSV and importing it every time. So let's copy this because now we're going to import a different type of file. So now we've been doing read CSV, but we can also import text files. Now you can do that with the read CSV. We can import text files. Let's look at this one. We have the same one. It's countries of the world except now it's a text file because I just converted it for this video. I'll copy that as a path. And so now when we do this, oop",

And then all of our values are the exact same with this backslash t. That's because we need to use a separator. And I'll show you just a little bit how we can do this in a different way. But with that read CSV, this is how we can do it. We'll just say sep is equal to we need to do backslash t. Now let's try running this. And as you can see, it now has it broken out into country and region. We could also do it the more proper way. And this is the way you should do it. And I'll get rid of these really quickly. But just want to keep them there in case you want to see that. But you can also do read underscore table. And let's get rid of this separator. And now we have no separator. It's just reading it in as a table. Let's run this. And it reads it in properly the first time. This read table can be used for tons of different data types. But typically, I've been using it for like text files. We can also read in that CSV. So let's change this right here to CSV. We can read it in as a CSV.

That's why each one has a different name. So now we're reading this in as the JSON. Let's read it in and it read it in properly. Now let's go ahead and copy this and take a look at Excel files because Excel files are a little bit different than other ones that we've looked at. So let's just do read underscore cell. And let's go down to our file explorer. And let's actually open up this workbook. As you can see, we have sheet one right here, but we also have this world population which has a lot more data. Let's say we just wanted to read in sheet one. We can do that. Or by default, it's going to read in this world population because it's the first sheet in the Excel file. Well, let's go ahead and take a look at that. Let's get out of here. And let's say, oops, I forgot to copy the file path. Let's go ahead and copy as path. And we'll put it right here. And let's just read it in with no arguments or anything in there or no parameters. When we read it in, it's reading in that very first sheet. So this is the one that has all of the data. Now let's say we wanted to read in that extra sheet name or the second sheet name. We'll just go comma sheet underscore name. So it's equal to and then we can specify sheet. Was it sheet one like this? Yes, it was. So we just had to specify the sheet name right here. And then it brought in that sheet instead of the default, which is the very first sheet in that Excel. And that definitely covers a lot of how you read in those files. Again, you can come in here and hit shift tab in this plus sign and take a look at all the documentation. And you can specify a lot of different things. Things that I didn't think were very important for you guys to know, especially if you're just starting out.

But if you're interested in any of these other ones or you have very unique data and you need to do that, you know, it's worth really getting in here and figuring things out. A few other things that I wanted to show you just in this kind of first video or this intro video on how to read in files. One thing that you may have noticed, especially in this file right here, is we're only looking at the first five and then the last five. So if we wanted to see all the data, all the data is in these like little three dots right here, right? We want to be able to see that data. But right now we can't. And that's because of some settings that are already within pandas and all we need to do is change that. So this one has 234 rows and four columns. So obviously we can see all the columns. Well, let's just change the rows. All we'll say is pd.set underscore option. Now what we need to do is we're going to change the rows. We're not going to change the columns at least not on this one. So we'll say, quote, display.max.rose. Now if we just run this or whatever data we bring in, it's going to be able to show the max rows. And then we'll say 235, although this two and 34 rows, I'm just going to be safe. Let's run this. And now it has changed it. So let's read in this file again and you'll see how it's changed. Now we have all the numbers and we have this little bar on the right that allows us to go down all the way to the bottom and all the way to the top. So now we can actually look and kind of skim and see our values. I like that better than just having that shorter version. We can do the exact same thing on columns as well. So if we look at this one, this is our JSON file. Has the same thing right here. We have what was it? 38 columns. But we can only see it's 20 or something like that. I can't remember. But we have 38. We can only see like let's say 15 of them or 20 of them. Well, did the exact same thing. And we'll just say pd.setoptions.max.columns. And we'll set that to 40 for that one.",

    "text": "When we run this, oops, let's get over here. When we run this one again, we can now scroll over and see every single one of our columns. Now that one is a, in my opinion, a lot more useful. I like being able to see every single column. So definitely something that you should be using, especially when you have these really large files. You want to be able to see a lot of the data and a lot of the columns. So when you're slicing and dicing and doing all the things are about to learn in this Panda series, you know, you know what you're looking at. I also want to show you just how to kind of look at your data in these data frames as well. So that's also pretty important. So let's go right down here. And the very last one that we imported was this one right here, this red Excel. So this data frame is the only one that's going to read in. Let's run it. This is the last one to be run. So this variable right here, DF, it won't be applied to all these other ones, which we can always go back and change this. Typically, you'll do something like data frame too. You want to do something like that. So let's keep data frame two. So what we're going to do is we're going to bring data frame two right down here. And we want to take a look at some of this data. We want to know a little bit more about it. Something that you can do is data frame two.info and we'll do an open parentheses. And when we run this, it's going to give us a really quick breakdown of a little bit of our data. So we have our columns right here, rank CCA3 country and capital. It's saying we have 234 values in those columns because there's 234 scroll up here because there's 234 rows. That tells me that there's no missing data in here. At least not completely missing like null values. There is something in each of those rows that count tells me it's non-null. So there's no null values and it tells me the data type. So it's ringing in as an integer, an object, an object, and an object. And it also tells us how much memory it's using, which is also pretty neat because when you get really, really large data types, memory usage and knowing how to work around that stuff does become more important than when you're working at these really small, you know, sample sizes that we're looking at. We can also do, oops, let me get rid of that. We can also do data frame two. And we'll do shape. And for this one, we do not need the parentheses. And all this is going to tell us is we have 234 rows and four columns. We're also able to look at the first few values or rows in each of these data frames. So we can just say data frame two dot head. And if we do that, it's going to give us the first five values. But we can specify how many we want. You can say head 10. We'll give us the first 10 rows right here. We can do the exact same thing. Let's go right down here and we'll say tail. So they'll give us the last 10 rows within our data frame. Now let's copy this and let's say we don't want to actually look at all of these values or all these columns. We can specify that by saying df2 and, oops, let's get rid of all of this. And we'll say with a quote, we'll say rank. And now we can take just a look, the rank data. Now we can't do that by doing the index or at least not like this. If we want to use this index that is right here, we can. But there's a very special function called LOC and I look for that. And I'm going to have an entire video on this because it does get a little bit more complex. But there's df2 dot loc and there's LOC and I look. It stands for location and I location. That's only for the indexes, whether it's the x axis or the y axis. Those are the indexes. And for location, it's looking for the actual text, the actual string of the index. So if we come up here, that data frame two, we can specify two, 24 and it'll give us this information right here, a little different formats. Let's go. Rocket, I will say 224. And when we run this, it gives us our rank, cca, country capital with our values over here. Kind of like a dictionary almost. Now let's copy this and we'll say df2 dot i, LOC. And right now, these look the exact same. But we haven't really talked a lot about changing the index. And you can change the index to a string or a different column or something like that. And we'll look at that in future videos. The iLock looks at the integer location. So even if these, let's go right up here, even if this index had changed to, let's say this rank or this cca, three or country or whatever you",

So then when we look at this, it's going to be the exact same. But if we had changed that index, this LOC is the one that we could search on and we could search ooze back this stand as I he spelled ooze back a stand. I nailed it. So that is how you use lok and iLock. Again, I just wanted to show you a little bit about how you can look at your data frame or search within your data frame. Now in future videos, I'm going to dive a lot deeper into a lot of the concepts that we just looked at because I just kind of touched on them. I wanted you to have a brief introduction to them so that in future videos, I'm not just dropping everything on you all at once. So hopefully this was a good quick introduction to those topics. You should be able to read in a file now, see your data frame and kind of look at it in a few different ways that we just looked at. And I hope that that was helpful.

So I'm going to say data frame is equal to and we'll say pandas and I need to import my pandas. So we'll say import and as as PD that's pretty important, I think. So PD dot read underscore CSV and we'll do R and then we'll say the world population CSV. So let's run this all our data frame right here. And this is the data frame that we're going to be filtering through and ordering in pandas. So let's kick it off. The first thing that we can do is filter based off of the columns. So the data within our columns. So Asia, Europe, Africa, or whatever data we may h",

    "text": "ave in that column. So let's go right down here. We're going to say DF and then within it, we're going to specify what column we're going to be filtering on. We're going to say DF with another bracket and we'll say rank. So we're going to be looking at this rank column right here. And we'll say in that rank column, we want to do greater than 10. And that's actually going to be a lot of them. Let's do less than. So when we run this, it's only going to return these values that are less than 10. We can also do less than or equal to all of these comparison operators. So less than or equal to. So now we have all the ranks one through 10. Now if we look at these countries, we can specify by specific values, almost exactly like we did here. But instead of doing a comparison operator, like we did right here, and including those names, let's say Bangladesh and Brazil, we can use the is in function, almost like an in function in SQL, if you know SQL. So let's go right down here. And we're going to say specific underscore entries. So right now we're just going to make a list of the countries that we want. And then we'll say Bangladesh and Brazil. So let's go right down here. And we'll say, okay, for these specific countries, from the data frame, let's do our bracket. We'll say in this country column, so we'll do data frame and then another bracket for country. So in this country column, we can do dot is in and then open parentheses and then look for our specific countries. So we're looking at just this column and we're saying is in. So we're looking at are these values within this column. And we're getting this error and this looks very, very odd. Let me, um, this doesn't look right. There we go. I just had some syntax errors. I apologize made it way more complicated than it needs to be, but here's how you use this is in function. So we're looking at Bangladesh and Brazil. And we return those rows with Bangladesh and Brazil. Really quickly, I wanted to give a huge shout out to the sponsor of this entire pandas series. And that is you to me. You to me has some of the best courses at the best prices. And it is no exception when it comes to pandas courses. If you want to master pandas, this is the course that I would recommend. It's going to teach you just about everything you need to know about pandas. So a huge shout out to you to me for sponsoring this panda series. And let's get back to the video. We can also do a contains function kind of similar to is in except it's more like the like in SQL as well. I'm comparing a lot of this to SQL because when you're filtering things, I always, my brain always goes to SQL. But in pandas, it's called the contains. So let's do, let's actually copy this because I don't want to make the same mistake again. Let's do that and we'll do the bracket. But instead of dot is in we're going to do dot string dot contains and then open parentheses. So we're going to be looking for a string. If it contains, if it contains, let's do United, almost like United States or any other United. So let's run this. And as you can see, we have United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, United States, Virgin Islands. So we can kind of search for a specific string or a number or a value within our data or within that column of country. Now so far, we've only been looking at how you can filter on these columns. We can also filter based off of the index as well. And there's two different ways you can do it or two of the main ways. There's filter and then there's loke and I loke. Loke stands for location and I loke stands for integer location. And if you've seen other previous videos, I've kind of mentioned those so we can take a quick look at all of those. So really quickly, we need to set an index because the index right now is not the best. We'll set our index to country. So let's say DF 2 is equal to DF dot set underscore index and we'll say country. Now I'm just doing DF 2 because later on I want to use that data frame again. So I'm just going to assign it to another data frame so we can just easily switch back and forth. So now we have this index as the country and what we can do is use the filter function. So let's go down here. We'll say DF 2 dot filter. We'll do an open parenthesis and now we can specify our items. So these are actually going to be specifying which columns we want to keep. So we're going to say items is equal to then we'll make a list. We'll say, continent. Hope that's how we spell continent. I'm always messing up with my stuff here, my spelling. Then we'll do CC a three because why not? You can specify which ever one's you want. When we run this, it's going to only bring in those two columns. Now by default, it's choosing the access for us, but we can also specify which access we want to search on. So if we say access is equal to zero, it's actually going to search this access. This is zero access. This is the one axis. So where our columns are is one. So if we go back and do one, we're searching on that one axis or those header accesses again. And this is the default, but you can specify that. So if you just want to search on filtering right here, you can do that. Let's actually copy this and do that right down here. Just so you can see what it looks like. But let's search for Zimbabwe and we'll do Zimbabwe and we're looking at the zero axis, which is the up and down on the left hand side. And when we filter on that, we can filter by Zimbabwe by looking just at the country index. We can also use the like just like we did before. And I'll show you the exact same demonstration that we did, which you can say like is equal to. And instead of having to put in a concrete text, you can just say United, just like we did before. And we're searching where the access is equal to zero, which again is this left handed access. So now we're looking for United. And it's going to give us all of the countries or all the indexed values that have united in it. Like we were talking about before, we also have Locke and ILocke. So we can say dataframe2.locke. Now this is a specific value. So we'll do United States. So location is just looking at the actual name or the value of it, not its position. So if we search for United States, it's going to give us this right here where it gives us all of the columns for United States and then all of the values for United States. Or we can do the ILocke, which is the integer location, which is not the exact same, because we're looking at the string for the Locke, we're looking at this string, but underneath it, there still is a position. That's that integer location. Let's do a completely random one. Let's just say three. If we look at the third position, it's going to give us ASM, which I'm not exactly sure what it is, but it still gives us basically the same kind of output, which is the columns and the values. So that's another way t",

    "text": "hat you can search within your index when you're actually trying to filter down that data. Now let's go look at the order by and let's start with the very first one that we looked at. Let's do data frame. That's why I kept it because I wanted to use it later. Now we can sort and order these values instead of it just being kind of a jumbled mess in here. We can sort these columns however we would like ascending, descending multiple columns, single columns. And let's look at how to do that. So we'll say data frame and then we'll do data frame, look at rank again, just like we were doing above. And let's do data frame where it's less than 10. I should have just gotten a copy of this. I apologize. So now we have this data frame that is greater than 10. Now we can do dot sort underscore values. And this is the function that's going to allow us to sort everything that we want to sort. So we can do by is equal to and we'll just order it by the exact same thing that we were doing or calling it on. We'll do rank. So now what is going to do is going to order our rank column. And as you can see, did that one, two, three, four, five, we can also do it with ascending or descending. So if you want to you can look in here and see what you can do. So we'll do ascending. We'll say that's equal to true. And so that's the automatic default. So that didn't change anything. But if we say false, it's going to be descending from highest to lowest. So now we have it in the opposite direction. Now we don't have to just order or sort this on one single column. We can do multiple columns. And we can do that by making a list right here. Whoops. Make a list. Just like that. And we'll input different ones as well. So now let's input our country. And when we run this, it will give us rank of 9876 as well as the country of Russia, Bangladesh, Brazil. Now, if you noticed, the country really didn't change because the rank stayed the exact same. That's because there's an order of importance here. And it starts with the very first one. If we change this around and we look at this one and put it on right here, now the country is going to be descended and the rank would come second. So it's not going, the rank isn't going to really have any effect here. So now we have the country United States, Russia, Pakistan, and the rank really didn't get ordered at all. Now if we want to see how that can actually work, let's do continent right here. And actually put it right here and do country here. So if we run this, it's first going to come and it's going to organize or sort the continent. Then it's going to come back and go to the country and then it's going to sort the country. So keep your eye right here in this Asia area because we're going to sort this differently than ascending. So we have ascending false and that applies to both of these. It's false and false. But we can specify which one we want to do. We can do a false here and a true here. So we'll do false, comma, tr",

Now, what's really great about this index is we're able to search based off just this index. And so we can filter on it and basically look through our data with it. And there are two different ways that you can do that. At least this is a very common way that people who use pandas will do to kind of search through that index. The first one is called lock. And there's lock and I lock. And that stands for location or integer location. Let's look at lock first. Let's say DF dot lock. And then we'll do a bracket. Now we're able to specify the actual string, the label. So let's go right up here. And let's say Albania. So we'll say Albania. So again, this is just looking at the location. Let's run this.",

And this should give us the exact same data. Now let's take a look at multi indexing and we'll come back to a little bit of this in a second. So multi indexing is creating multiple indexes. We're not just going to create the country as the index. Now we're going to add an additional index on top of that. So let's pull up our data frame. Right now we have the country. But let's do dot reset index. And we'll say in place equals true. Oops. Let's run it. So now we have our data frame. Now let's set our index. But this time when we set our index, we're going to add the country as the index as well",

Then we'll do a parentheses and instead of just doing country like we did before, we're going to create a list. And we'll do it like that. And then we'll say, oops, continent and separated by a comma. So we have continents and country. Let's just say in place is equal to true. Now when we run this, we're going to have two indexes. Let's see what this looks like. And let's run this. So now we have country as well as continent as our index. Now you may notice that these indexes are repeating themselves on this continent index. We have Europe right here and Europe right here as well as Asia and Asia. And it looks a little bit funky. But we are able to sort these values and make a look a lot better. So let's go ahead and try this. We'll do df dot sort underscore index. And when we run this, it should sort our index alphabetically. And we can also look in here and see what kind of things we can, you know, specify. We can specify the axis, but it's automatically going to be looking at the zero. This is zero. And this is one. So we have two axes within our data frame. You choose the level, whether it's ascending or not ascending in place, kind, string sort of remaining, all of these different things. The only one that I really, you know, think is worth looking at is the ascending. We already know some of these other ones. But if we look at ascending, let's run it. Now it's sorted these. And so now it's kind of grouped together. So we have Africa and all the African ones as well as South America and all the South American ones. Let's really quickly say pd dot set underscore option. And we'll say display dot max dot columns. And just like this, let's run it. And I need to specify specify right here. Let's see how many rows we have. 235. So let's do two 35. Let's run this. And now when we run this, you can see that Africa is all grouped together in all the countries are an alphabetical order under i",

And then when we run this, it's the exact opposite. So it starts with South America. The last one and then goes in reverse alphabetical order. We could also say false, make a list and do comma true. And just like this. And then it would sort this first column as false and this next column as true. So you can really customize it. But, you know, for what we're doing, we don't need any of that. We just need to be able to see this right here. So now when we try to search by our index, like we did before, we did datafram.look. Now when we did that and we said, you know, let's say Angola, when we specify Angola, it's not going to work properly because it's searching in this first index for the first string that we have. We can search Africa. Let's search for Africa. And now we have all the African countries. And if we want to specify to Angola, we can also go down another level, oops, by doing Angola. And now we have what we were looking at before where we're calling all the data within those, but we couldn't do it just based off Africa because we had an additional index right here. So once we call it both indexes, now we get this view. But let's look at that. I look really quick. When we run this, let's just say one because right up here, oh, we have Angola zero and then one.

Whereas this one does not go based off that multi indexing, it's going to go based off the initial index or the integer based index. So that's a lot about indexing in pandas. We'll cover even a few more things in future videos as we get more and more into pandas. But this is a lot of what indexing looks like within pandas.

So right here we have our flavor of ice cream. We have our base flavor, whether it was vanilla or chocolate, whether I liked it or not, the flavor rating, texture rating, and it's overall or it's total rating. Now these are all my own personal scores. So you know, I've spent years researching this. So these are all very accurate. But this should be a low stress environment to learn group by and the aggregate functions. So the first thing that we can do is look at our group by now you can't group by while you can you can group by flavor. But as you can see, these are all unique values. What we need is something that has duplicate values or or similar values on different rows that are grouped together. So thi",

And this will then group together those values and I need to make sure I can spell properly. This will group those flavors together. So let's run this. And as you can see, it actually is its own object. So it has a group by df.groupby object. So now that we've grouped them, let's give it a variable. So we'll say group underscore by underscore frame. Instead, it's equal to copy this. We'll run it. And now what we need to do is run our aggregations in order to get an output. So we're going to say dot mean. And that's all we're going to put just for now just to get an output that we can take a look off and then we'll build from there. So let's go ahead and run this. And right here, we have our base flavor, which is now saying is the index of chocolate or vanilla. And then it's taking the mean or the average of all the columns that have integers. Notice that it did not take the liked column and it did not take the flavor column because those are strings and they cannot aggregate those and we'll take a look at that later. But it took all the values that have integers and then it gave us the average of those ratings. Really quickly, I wanted to give a huge shout out to the sponsor of this entire panda series.

    "text": "ck to the video. So right off the bat as averages with chocolate, I have a much higher rating overall than the ones with the nila bases. Now we can actually combine all of this together into one line. We can do something like this. So we'll say df.groupby. We'll say dot mean just like this. And this will actually run it before we didn't have any aggregating function on there. So it didn't run. But now that we combine it all into one, it will run properly. Now there are a lot of different aggregate functions, but I'm going to show you some of the most popular ones and the most common ones that you will see. So let's copy this right here. So we can do dot count. And when we run this, we can look at the count. And this will show us the actual count of the rows that were aggregated. So for chocolate, we have three. So there's going to be three all the way across. And for vanilla, we had six. So we're looking at a higher count of vanilla, which if you're comparing it to this mean up here, there could be a big skew towards the chocolate. Because if you have one or two good chocolates, it could really pull the numbers up. Whereas if you had two good vanilla's, but all the other ones are bad, it pulls that average down. So knowing the count of something is really good. Let's take a look at the next one. And we can do min and max. And I'll just run these really quickly. We can do min. And when we run this, the first thing that you should notice is that it now has a flavor and a liked column. And that's because min and max will actually look at the first letter in the string or the first set of letters. If there are, you know, chocolate, something, it'll look at the first. And then it'll actually populate it. So chocolate with the CH chocolate is the very first or the minimum value for that string. And for a cake batter, that is the minimum value in vanilla as well. Now with the light, it's interesting because apparently I liked all the chocolate ones. I'm going to go take a look. So chocolate, I liked chocolate, I liked chocolate, I liked. So there is no no option in this liked column. So yes, was the only option. And now let's look at max. Oops. And it should do the exact opposite, which is going to take the highest value, even if it's a string. So Rocky road, the letter R comes later in the alphabet. So that's what it's looking at. And so does vanilla. And then we have yes as well. An",

    "text": "d then of course, right here, it's taking the max value. So before we were looking at min, I just focused on those, but it still does the exact same thing to these integer columns as well. So for the max value for vanilla, it was mint chocolate chip. That was our base. So I had a rating of 10 for this vanilla row or grouping. And then we can also look at the sum. And there are all the sums for these. And again, it only does integer because we can't add the strings here. The sum or the total values for all of them. And for the total values, since we had six rows that were grouping into this vanilla, we now have a lot or much higher score for vanilla. Now that's a really simple way to do your aggregations, but there is actually an aggregation function. And let's take a look at this because this is a little bit more complex, although when I write it out or show you, hopefully it makes a lot of sense. We can do dot a gg. So this is our aggregate function. And what we need to pass into our aggregate function is actually a dictionary. So let's do an open parentheses and we're going to do a school wiggly bracket. And then we need to specify what we're going to be aggregating on or what column. Let's do this flavor rating. Let's copy this. We'll do flavor rating. And I need to put that as a string. And then we'll do a colon. And now we can specify what aggregate functions we want. So we've done some count mean min and max, all of those. And we can actually put all of those into here and perform all of those aggregations on just one column. So let's make a list. And then let's say mean max count and what's another one sum. Let's do all four of those only on this flavor rating column. And when we run this, we have our base flavor right here, chocolate and vanilla. But now we don't have multiple columns. We have one co",

And we'll say texture rating. And then a colon, I don't know why I spelled it out when I copied it, but I did. And then we'll do the exact same ones. And now when we run it, we're getting the exact same columns mean max count and sum for flavor rating. Then mean max count and sum for our texture rating. Now so far, we've only grouped on one column, but we can actually group on multiple columns. Let's go back up here to our data. I should have just copied this down here. Let's go back down and just look at this. So really, we only grouped it on this base flavor. But you can do multiple groupings or group by multiple columns. So let's do our base flavor, which we did already, as well as the liked column. So we're going to say df.group by then we'll do an open parentheses. And then instead of just passing through one string, we're going to do a list. And we'll say base, flavor, oops, comma, and then we'll do liked. So now when it groups this, it should put two groupings. And let's run this and just see oops, I got to say let's just do dot mean. So now we have our chocolate and a vanilla. And remember, chocolate only had yes. So that's the only one that it's going to group on. But vanilla had a no and a yes. So if we look at the vanilla, we have our base flavor vanilla. And then within liked, we have no and a yes, which can show us that within our vanilla when we group on these, our nose were really low. But our yeses were really high. We actually had a pretty similar rating or very close to the same rating as the ones we really liked in chocolate. And just like we did above, we can take this dot ag. And I'm going to copy this. And it'll perform it on each of those rows. Let me close that. And what did I do wrong? Oh, I need the squiggly bracket. And it'll show us each of those. So the mean max count and some for all of the chocolate and vanilla, as well as the groupings of liked yes and no. Now, after we've looked at all that and that's how I usually do it, there is one shortcut function that can give you some of these things just really quickly. And so let's go back up here and take this. It's just called describe. And if you've ever done it, it's just going to give you some high level overview of some of those different aggregations. So let's run this. And it's going to give us our chocolate and vanilla. And within each column, it's going to give us our count, our mean, our standard deviation. I believe is what that is. Our minimum 25%, 50, 75 and 100, which is our max, then our count and our mean. So a lot of those aggregate functions. But the describe is, you know, a very generalized function. We can't get as specific as we were with the previous ones that we were looking at. But I just wanted to throw this out there in case this is something that you'd be interested in because it, you know, technically is showing a lot of those aggregate functions just, you know, all at one time. So that is our group buying and aggregate functions within pandas. I hope that that was helpful. I hope that you understood, you know, everything that we were working on.

    "text": "Hello everybody. Today we're going to talk about merging, joining, and concatenating data frames in pandas. This whole video is basically around being able to combine two separate data frames together into one data frame. These are really important to understand when we're actually using the merge and the join. Right here we have what's called an inner join and the shaded part is what's going to be returned. It's only the things that are in both the left and the right data frames. Then we have an outer join or a full outer join and this will take all the data from the left data frame and the right data frame and everything that is similar. Basically it just takes everything. We also have a left join which is going to take everything from the left and then if there's anything that's similar it'll also include that. Then the exact opposite of that is the right join which is going to give us everything from the right data frame and it's going to give us everything that is similar but it's not going to give us anything that is just unique to the left data frame. This is just for reference because in a little bit when we start merging these these become very important. Just wanted to show you how that works visually. Let's get started by pulling in our files. First we're going to say import and as as pd. We'll run this and then we'll say data frame one and we'll also have a data frame two and these are the different data frames. The left and the right data frame that we'll be using to join merge and concatenate. We'll say data frame one is equal to pd.csv underscore read and we'll do r and here is our file path. So we have this lotr.csv that's our Lord of the Rings csv and let's call that really quickly so we can see what's in there and I'm having a dyslexic moment because it's supposed to be read underscore csv. I apologize for that but this is our data frame. This is our data frame one. We have three columns. It's their fellowship ID one thousand one two three and four. Their first name, Frodo Samwise, Gaelph, and Pipim and their skills hiding, gardening spells and fireworks. So this is our very first data frame that we're going to be working with. Let's go down a little bit. Let's pull this down here and we're just going to say day frame two, day frame two and this is the Lord of the Rings two. So let's pull this one in now. As you can see it's very similar. We have fellowship ID one two six seven eight. So we have three different IDs here. We don't have six seven and eight in this upper or this first data frame. We also have the first name. So Frodo and Sam or Samwise are in the very first and the second data frame. But now we have three new people, Baramir, Elrond and Legolas and now we have this age column which again is unique to just this second data frame. Really quickly I want to give a huge shout to these sponsors of this video and that is Zendesk. I've been using Zendesk for my company's customer analytics and his been absolutely phenomenal. They're going to be hosting a conference called Zendesk Relate on May 10th and they're going to talk all about customer analytics, chatbots and AI in this space. You can attend in person in San Francisco or you can attend virtually but space is limited so be sure to apply if you want to attend. So if you are a business leader and you want to make the most out of your customer data or you want to learn customer data analytics, I believe links in the description. Again, huge shout to Zendesk for sponsoring this video. Now the first one that I want to look at is merge. And I want to look at merge first because I think this one is the most important. I use this one more than any of the ones that we're going to talk about today. The merge is just like the joins that we were just looking at. The outer, the inner, the left and the right. And there's also one called cross and I'll show you that one although if I'm being honest, I don't really use that one that much but it's worth showing just in case you come into a scenario where you do want to do that. So let's go right down here and I want to be able to see these while we do it. So we're going to say data frame one and when we specify data frame one as the very first data frame, we say data frame dot merge. This is automatically going to be our left data frame. Then if we do our parentheses right here and we say data frame two, this is our right data frame. And let's see what happens when we do this. So what it's going to do in this, we didn't specify this is just a default. It's going to do an inner join. So it's only going to give us an output where specific values or the keys are the same. Now you can't see this but what is happening is it's taking this fellowship ID and saying I have one thousand and one here, a one thousand and two here. This is the exact same as up here with this fellowship ID and fellowship ID of one thousand one and two. But when we look at one thousand three and four, those aren't in this right data frame and six seven eight is not in this left data frame. So the only ones that match are this one thousand one and two",

This is the exact same as up here with this fellowship ID and fellowship ID of one thousand one and two. But when we look at one thousand three and four, those aren't in this right data frame and six seven eight is not in this left data frame. So the only ones that match are this one thousand one and two and that's why they get pulled in down here. But because we didn't explicitly say here's what I want to join or merge between these two data frames, it actually is looking at the fellowship ID and the first name. So it's taking in these unique values of photo and same wise, which are the same in both, which is why I pulled it over. But really quickly, let's just check and make sure that we did it on the inner join because again, we didn't specify anything. That was just the default. So we're going to say how is equal to and then we'll say inner and if we run this, it's going to be the exact same because again, the inner is the default. But now just to show you how it's kind of joining these two data frames together, I'm going to say on is equal to and then I'm only going to put fellowship ID. So let's run this. Now the first thing that you may have noticed is this first name underscore X and this first name underscore Y. What the merge does as kind of a default is when you are only joining on a fellowship ID, we have this right data frame with fellowship ID, the left data frame with the fellowship ID. If you're just joining on these and you're not joining on the first name and the first name, then it's going to separate those into an underscore X and an underscore Y and even though they have the exact same values, since we are not merging on that column, it automatically separates that into two separate columns so we can see the values within each of those columns. If we went into this on and we make a list, let's do like that, and we say comma and then we write first name, oops, first name and then we run this. It's going to look exactly like it did before. Again, it automatically pulled in both of these columns when it was merging at the first time, even though we didn't write anything. But if we actually write this, it's doing exactly what it was doing when we just had DF2, we're just now writing it out. Now there are other arguments that we can pass into this merge function. Let's hit shift tab and let's scroll down here. So within this merge function, we have a lot of different arguments that you can pass into it. First, we have this right, which is the right day of frame, which is this day of frame two. Then we have the how and the on, which we've already shown how to do. There's a left on, right on, left index, right index, not something you'll probably use that much, but you definitely can, if you want to look into that. And there's all these doc strings which show you exactly how to use all of these. So if you're interested in looking at the left and the right and the left index, it's all in here. But one that is really good is the sort and you can sort it saying either it's false or true. Then we have these suffixes. Now, if you remember when we took these out, what it automatically did was it put in these underscore x and underscore y, you can customize that and you can put in whatever you'd like instead of the underscore x and underscore y, you can put in some custom string for that. We also have an indicator and a validates. Again, all things that you can go in here and look at, I'm just going to show you the stuff that I use the most. So these things right here are things that I definitely use the most. So now that we've looked at the inner join, let's copy this right down here and let's look at the outer join and he's get a little bit more tricky. I think the inner join is probably the easiest one to understand. Let's look at the outer this build OUTER. I don't know why I always want to say OUTER. But let's run this and see what we get. So now this looks quite different. The inner join only gave us the values that are the exact same. This one is going to give us all of the values regardless of if they are the same. So we have one, two, three, four, six, seven, and eight. So let's go back up here. So we have one, two, three, four, one, two, and six, seven, and eight. So we don't have a one thousand and five. And then if you notice in this data frame right here, if the value doesn't have, so if we can't join on th",

So we have one, two, three, four, six, seven, and eight. So let's go back up here. So we have one, two, three, four, one, two, and six, seven, and eight. So we don't have a one thousand and five. And then if you notice in this data frame right here, if the value doesn't have, so if we can't join on the fellowship ID or the first name, like a legolas wasn't one that we joined on or that has a similar value in the left data frame, it just gives us an NAN, which is not a number. And it's going to do that for any value where it couldn't find that join or it couldn't match something within that either ID or first name. So in age, we also have that for the ones that weren't in the right data frame. We only had one thousand and one and one thousand two. So we'll have the age for both photo and Sam, but for Gandalf and Pippin, we don't have their corresponding IDs. And so it's just going to be blank for Gandalf and Pippin. And you can see that right here. So again, outer joins are kind of the opposite of inner joins. They're going to return everything from both. If there is overlapping data, it won't be duplicated. Now let's go on to the left join. And I'm going to pull this down right here. And now we're just going to say how is equal to left? And let's run this. So what this is going to do is it's going to take everything from the left table or the left data frame right here. So everything is from data frame one. Then if there is any overlap, it'll also pull the overlap to the, you know, whatever we're able to merge on from data frame two. So let's go back up to our data frame one and two. So it's going to pull everything from this left data frame because we're specifying we're doing a left join. So everything from the left data frame will be in there. We're also going to try to bring in everything from the right. But only if it matches or is able to merge. So just this information right here will come over. We weren't able to join on 106, 107 or 108. So really none of that information is going to come over. So let's go down and check on this. So again, we have one, two, three, four, all of the data with this first name and skills. Everything is in here. But then we are trying to bring over the age, but we only have matches with one thousand one and one thousand two. So only these two values will come in. Let's look at the right join because it's basically the exact opposite. Let's look at the right. And this is basically the exact opposite of the left in the fact that now we're only looking at the right hand. And then if there's something that matches in data frame one, then we will pull that in. So this is basically just looking like data frame two, except we're pulling in that skills column. And since only one thousand and one thousand and two are the same, that's why the skills values are here. Now, those are the main types of merges that I will use when I'm using a data frame. Or when I'm trying to merge a data frame, but there also is one called a cross or a cross join. And let's look at this one. And this one is quite a bit different. Here we go. Let's run this. So this one is different in that it takes each value from the left data frame and compares it to each value in the right data frame. So for Frodo in this left data frame, it looks at the Frodo in the right data frame. Samwise in the right data frame, legless, Elron and Baramir, all in the right data frame. Then it goes to the next value. Samwise does the exact same thing. Frodo, Samwise, legless, Elron, Baramir. And it does that for every single value. So let's go right back up here. So it's taking this this one thousand and one. It's comparing it to one two three four five. Then it's taking Samwise. It's comparing it to one two three four five. And off one two three four five. Pippin. And then you kind of see that pattern. And that's what a cross join is. There are very few in my opinion reasons for a cross join. Although you'll, if you ever do like an interview where you're being interviewed on Python, you will sometimes be asked on cross joins. But there aren't a lot of instances in actual work where you really use or need a cross join. Now let's take a look at joins and joins are pretty similar to the merge function.

And it can do a lot of the same thing except in my opinion, the join function isn't as easily understood as the merge function. It's a little bit more complicated. But let's take a look and see how we can join together these data frames using the join function. So let's go right up here. We're going to say data frame one dot join. And then we'll do data frame two very similar to how we did it before. And let's try running this. And it's not going to work. When we did the merge function, it had a lot of defaults for us. Let's go down and see what this error is. It says the columns overlap, but no suffix was specified. So it's telling us that it's trying to use the fellowship ID and the first name, just like the join did, except it's not able to distinguish which is which. And so we need to go in there and kind of help it out a little bit again, a little bit more hands on than the merge. But let's see what we can do to make this work. Let's do comma. And we'll say on. And let's really quickly let's open this up and kind of see what we have. So this one has less options than the merge does. We have other. And that's our other data frame. We can do on and we're going to specify, you know, what column do we want to join on? And then we can look at how do we want it to be a left and enter an outer, the same kind of types of joins as the merge. Then we have that left suffix, right suffix. And that's right here is kind of part of the issue that we were just facing is that those columns are the same. But if we say left suffix, it'll give us an underscore, whatever we want to specify any string, four columns that are both and the left and the right. We can give it a unique name. So we'll no longer have that issue. And then we can also sort it like we did on the other one. But anyways, let's go back to our on. We'll say on is equal to and then we'll say fellowship ID. Let's try running this. And we're still getting an error. It's just not as simple as the merge. So let's keep going. So now let's specify the type. So we'll say how is equal to and we'll do an outer. And if we run this, it still doesn't work. We're still getting the exact same issue as the less suffix and the right suffix. So now let's finally resolve it. I just wanted to show you how a little bit more frustrating it was. But now let's say L suffix is equal to. And now it automatically when we did the merge did an underscore X. But we can do let's do underscore left. And then we can do a comma, do right suffix. And we'll say is equal to and we'll do underscore right now when we run this, it should work properly. Let's run this. So this is our output and obviously it looks quite a bit different. Over here, we have this fellowship ID. Then we also have fellowship ID left first name left fellowship ID right and first name right. So it just doesn't look right. Now, something I didn't specify when I first started this because I kind of wanted to show you is that the join usually is better for when you're working with indexes. Before when we were using the merge, we were using the column names and that worked really well and is pretty easy to do. But as you can see right here when we're trying to use these column names, it's not working exceptionally well. Let's go ahead and create our index. And then I can show you how this actually works and how it works a little bit better when we're working with just the index. Although you can get it to work just the same as the merge. It's just a lot more work. So let's go right down here. And let's go and say df4. So we'll create a new data frame. We'll say df1.set underscore index and we'll do an open parentheses and we'll say we want to do this index on the fellowship ID. And then we're going to do the join. So now we're going to say join. So we're setting an index. So we're setting that index on the fellowship ID. Now we're going to join it on df2.set underscore index. And then we're also going to do that on the fellowship ID and I'll just copy this. Oh geez. I hate it when I do that. Okay. Now we also want to do specify the left and the right index. So I'll just copy this as we do need to specify this. Now let's try running the data frame for. So really quickly just to recap, we",

So I'll just copy this as we do need to specify this. Now let's try running the data frame for. So really quickly just to recap, we were setting the indexes. We were doing the same thing above. Right. We have this join. We were joining data frame one with data frame two. Now we're joining data frame one with data frame two, except in both instances, we're setting the index as fellowship ID. So we're joining now on that index. So now let's run this. And this should look a lot more similar to the merge than the join that we did above. Except now the fellowship ID right here is actually an index. So it's just a little bit different. But we can still go in here and do how is equal to outer. Oops. Let's say outer. So we can still specify our different types of joins or the different way that we can merge or join these data frames together. We can still specify that. Again, it's just a little bit different. And that's why for most instances, I'm using that merge function because it's just a little bit more seamless, a little bit more intuitive. The join function can still get the job done. But as you can see, it takes a little bit more work. Now let's look at concatenate concatenating data frames can be really useful. And the distinction between a merge and join versus the concatenate is that the concatenate is kind of like putting one data frame on top of the other rather than putting one data frame next to one another, which is like the merge and the join. So concatenating them is just a little bit different and how it'll operate. But let's actually write this out and see how this looks. Let's go up here and we'll say pd.cancat. We'll do an open parentheses. And then we're going to concatenate data frame one, ama, data frame two. That's all we have to write. And let's run this. And so just like I said, it literally took the first data frame, one, two, three, four and put it on top of the right data frame, one, two, six, seven, eight. So that is our left data frame. This is our right data frame. And they're literally just sitting one on top of the other. But just like when we merge either with a left or a right, when you have these skills and there aren't any values that populate for them, it is going to say not a number. And since we're not actually joining, we're not joining on one and two, even though this one and this one is the same rows, it's not populating that value because again, we're not joining these together. We're just concatenating and putting one on top of the other. Now if we go into this concaten, we say shift tab, there are a lot of different things that we can do, which if you remember the zero axis is the left hand index and the axis of one is the top index, which is the columns. So you can specify that. And we can also do joins. And this is the one that I'm going to take a look at. But there are other ones that you can look into as well. But let's look at join. Let's do comma. And we'll say join is equal to. And let's do an inner join. So let's see what happens with this. As you can see, it is only taking the columns that are the same. That's what this inner is doing. It's joining these columns together. And the ones that were different, they didn't take because again, we weren't able to combine them. They aren't similar between both data frames. Let's do an outer. And now it's going to take all of them. And like I said, that's doing this on these columns right here. But we can also do it on this axis as well. So let's go ahead and say axis is equal to one. And when we run this, now it's joining us on this index right here of zero, one, two, three, four. So now these ones are being joined together. And it's putting it side by side much like a merge wood. So that's how concatenate works. And I'm going to show you one more thing. And again, it's not up here in this title because it's not one that I recommend, but it's one called append. The append function is used to append rows from one data frame to the end of another data frame. And then we can return that new data frame. And so let's do data frame one dot append to an open parentheses. And we'll say data frame two, very similar to how we've been doing other things. And let's run this. And",

And as you can see, this is almost exactly like how the concatenate did when we first did it. But if we read kind of this warning, it's saying the frame dot append method is deprecated and will be removed from pandas in the future version, use pandas.cancate instead. So it's literally warning us, you know, append is on its way out. If you want to do exactly what you're doing right here, go and try concatenate because that'll do the exact same thing. So I'm not really going to show you any other variations of append because there's no reason it's going to be on its way out in the next version. So that is our video on merge, join and concatenate and append as well in pandas. And I hope that that was helpful. I hope that you learned something. I mean, this stuff is really important because oftentimes you're not just working with one CSV or one JSON or one text file, you're working with multiple of them and you need to combine them all into one data frame. And so this is a really, really important concept and thing to understand with that being said, be sure to like and subscribe. Check out all my other videos on Python and pandas.

Now let's go in here really quickly. Let's hit shift tab. And this is going to come up. And this is pretty important because this kind of is going to tell us what we can do within this plot.

We can do a line plot or a zontal, a vertical bar plot, histogram box plot. And then a few others, including area pie density, all these other things.

And when we run this, we'll get this right here. And that was super, super easy. You created a line plot by literally doing just about nothing. But by default, it's going to give us a line plot. So if we come up here, we say kind, and let me get that other way, is equal to line. And we run this. So by default without us actually having to input anything, it's giving us that line plot as a default. So we can specify that's a line plot. As you can see, we already have all of our data right here. We didn't have to specify anything. It kind of automatically took it in. It is visualizing all three of these columns. And it has this little legend right here. And we can specify where we want that. There is an argument to be able to do that. It also gave us these tick marks of two four six eight 10 again, it read in and said it's only going from 0.0 to 1.0. That is kind of the peak. And so it kind of automatically gave us these ticks for us. Again, that's another thing that you can specify. We make it go up to two five 10, a thousand, whatever you want it to be. And then we're doing this based off of this date value right here. Really quickly, I wanted to give a huge shout out to the sponsor of this entire panda series. And that is you to me.

It's going to teach you just about everything you need to know about pandas. So huge shout out to you and me for sponsoring this panda series. And let's get back to the video. If we wanted to break these out by the actual column, we could go in here and say subplot is equal to true. And it's actually subplots. And now we can run that. And then we can see each of those columns being broken out by themselves. Instead of them all being in one visualization, it's now three separate visualizations. Now let's go right over here. We're going to get rid of the subplots. I want to show you just some of the different arguments that you can use to make this look nice. Because I don't want to do this on every single visualization. I just want to show you what you can do. So we have this one right here. We get out of title. Notice there's no title or anything really telling us what that is. So you can say comma, idle, and we'll say ice, cream, ratings. If we run this, we now have this nice title right here. Now we can also customize the labels or",

It automatically took that for us, but we can customize that if we'd like to. All we have to do is comma. And then we'll say x label is equal to. And so our x is this date one right here. And we can say daily rating. And then we can do the y label. We'll say y label is equal to. And for this one, we can say scores. I hope you cannot hear my dog in the background because they are being insane. But let's go ahead and run this. And now we have these daily ratings on the x axis and on the y axis. We have scores. Now let's go right down here and start taking a look at our next kind of visualization, which is going to be a bar plot. So we'll do df dot plot. We'll do kind is equal to. And for this one, we're going to say bar. Now this is what your typical bar plot will look like. And a lot of the arguments that we just did on the line plot, you can also apply to this bar plot. Something that's unique to the bar plot is that you can also make it a stacked bar plot. All we have to do is go in here. We'll say comma. And we'll say stacked is equal to true. So now it's going to make it a stacked bar chart. Instead of just, you know, your regular bar chart. Let's go ahead and run this. And as you can see, this is now stacked on top of one another with each of these columns, all representing the values that they have. Now we don't always have to do every single column. We can also specify the column that we want. So let's take the flavor rating, for example, I could do. Lavor. Oops. Lavor rating. Good night. Lavor rating. And then it's only going to take in that flavor rating column. And if you notice, we don't have a legend. That's only when you have multiple values, which we are only looking at this one column. So all the values are right here. Now in this bar chart, it automatically d",

And then we'll say bar H. And I don't know if I can keep in that kind equals bar. Let me run this. Yeah, I need to get rid of that because the bar.h is its own, um, this is its own function. So now I'm going to run this. It should just have a stacked bar chart, except now it should be horizontal. So now you can see this worked properly. It's basically the exact same thing as a vertical bar chart, just now horizontal, which may look better, especially depending on if you have values like this or, you know, something else that just looks better being horizontal. Now the next one that we're going to take a look at is the scatter plot. So we're going to say df.plot.scatter. And if we run this, we're going to get an error. What we need in order to run this properly is we need to specify the x and the y axis in order for this scatter plot to work. So let's go here and we'll say x is equal to and we can take any of our columns that we have up here. So we'll say x is equal to texture rating. And then y is equal to and do overall rating. Now when we run this, it should work properly. Let's go ahead and take a look. Now if we go in here and we do shift tab, we can also see some other things that we can specify.

So we have a much larger number. Let's do 500 and see what that looks like. So we can make these much larger on our visualization depending on what you're looking for. We can also look at the color. Let's put comma c. So for color, we can say color is equal to and let's do yellow. Let's see if this works. So now we've changed it to yellow that looks absolutely terrible, but it doesn't work. Now let's move on to the histogram. Histogram is always a good one. It's very similar to something like a bar chart, but what's great about a histogram is you can specify the bins. So let's go ahead and say df dot plot dot hist. Then we'll do an over parentheses and let's go ahead and hit shift tab in here. Take a look at this one as well. So some of our parameters are the actual columns of the data frames that we want to pull in. We can choose the bins and they have a default of 10 in here. And so let's take a look at how this works. So we'll just run this as it is. So this is by default what this histogram is going to look like. Let's go ahead and specify our bins. We'll just say it was 10 by default. Let's just do 20. See what that looks like. So there's smaller columns right off the bat. And remember, histograms are really good for showing distribution of variables. You know, that's really what a histogram is for. But of course, since these are completely random numbers, this histogram isn't going to make any sense at all, but you can at least kind of see visually how it works. And if I didn't mention it before, which I should have, the bins represent how many kind of tick marks are down here. So if",

And this is what it shows it, you know, it's showing the distribution of those bins across however many you want. So the 10 by default, you know, it usually is pretty good for a lot of different things. Now let's go down here and look at the box plot. And the box plot is a pretty interesting one.

But I don't use this one a lot if I'm being honest. That's why it's kind of towards the end of the video. But you definitely can do it. Let's go on to our very last one of the video.

You definitely have to do some research and some googling around just to kind of figure out how to do those things. Now one last thing that I wanted to show and something, you know, I could have probably done at the beginning, is you can actually change what visual this is. And we can do that pretty easily. Within Matplotlib there are different styles. And so let's go right here. Let's add a new row, a new cell. And we'll say print, we'll do PLT. So that's that Matplot Lib right here. We'll do PLT.stile.available. And what this is going to do, whoops, what this is going to do is show us all these different types of stylings that you can do to kind of change up this visualization. And then once we find the one that we like, we'll just do PLT.stile.use. And then in the parentheses, we'll just specify which one we want.

We have this first name and everything looks pretty good here except in this last name column. Looks like we have some errors. We have some forward slashes, some dots, some null values. So definitely I have to clean that up because we don't want that in the data. We have a phone number. And it looks like we have a lot of different formats as well as NAs, not a number. Just lots of different stuff. So we're going to need to standardize that. So clean it up and then standardize it to where it all looks the same. We also have address and it looks like on some of these we just have a street address, but on some of the other ones we have like a street address and another location. It was a zip code in some of them. So we'll probably want to split those out. We have a paying customer which is yes and knows and some of those are not the same. So I have to standardize that. We have a do not contact and the same thing as the paying customer. And we have this not useful column which we'll probably just want to get rid of. Okay, so the scenario is that we got handed this list of names and we need to clean it up and hand it off to the people who are actually going to make these calls to this customer list. So they want all the data in here and standardized and clean so that the people who are making those calls can just make those calls as quickly as possible.

Normally the very first thing that I do when I'm working with a data set most of the time except very rare cases when you're actually supposed to have duplicates is I actually go and drop the duplicates from the data set completely. All you have to do for that is say df dot drop underscore duplicates. So they make it super easy for you. Let's just run it. And up here is our original data set. We have this 19 and 20 and those are obviously duplicates. They have the exact same data. It's just a duplicate row that we need to get rid of. If we look right down here, we no longer have that 20.

And then we'll start getting into the really tough stuff. So the next thing that I want to do is remove any columns that we don't need. I don't want to clean data that we're not going to use. So if we're just looking through here, you know, they may need, you know, first name, last name, phone number for sure, address might give them some information of where they're calling to or time zone.

We'll do an open parentheses drop. Just means we are dropping that column. And we can specify that by saying columns is equal to and then we'll paste in that column that we want to delete.

And it is no exception when it comes to pandas courses. If you want to master pandas, this is the course that I would recommend. It's going to teach you just about everything you need to know about pandas. So huge shout out to you to me for sponsoring this panda series. And let's get back to the video. Now let's kind of go column by column and see what we need to fix. And we'll start on this left hand side. This customer ID to me looks perfectly fine. I'm not going to mess with it at all. The first name at a glance also looks perfectly fine. I don't see anything wrong with it visually, which is a good thing. Although sometimes that can be deceiving and it can cause errors down the line, but we're not going to assume that there are errors in here. Now let's look at this last name. Now the last name obviously I'm seeing some obvious things things that we talked about when we were first looking at this data set. We have this forward slash which we definitely need to get rid of. We have no values. So not a number right here. We have some periods as well as an underscore right here. So all those things I think we should clean up and get rid of it so that when the person is making these calls, you know, it's all cleaned up for them. So how are we going to do that? We can actually do this in several different ways, but let's just copy this last name. The first one I'm going to show you is strip and write it kind of like this. We'll say data frame and then we'll specify the column that we're working with because we don't want to make these changes or strip all of these values from everywhere. We only want to do it on just this column. If we do this and we don't specify the column name, it will apply it to everywhere. So if we're trying to do these, yeah, let's say, but, but, but, but, these underscores, maybe that would mess with something else in another column and we don't want that. So we just want to specify just this last name. So let's go last name dot string dot strip. Now what strip does, and let's see if we can open this up really quickly. We can't. But what strip does I was just I was hitting shift tab in here to see if it could bring up, you know, some of the notes on it. But what strip does is it takes either the left side or the right side. Well, L strip takes from the left side, R strip takes from the right side and strip takes from both. But you can strip values off the left and the right hand side. And we can specify those values. Now for what we're doing in this column, we can just use strip because as you can see this forward slash these dots as well as this underscore are all on the far sides. If there was a value like swan underscore song, the strip wouldn't work at all because it's not on the outside of the value or the word. So we can use strip. I'll also show you how to use replace and replace is another really good option for things like this. But let's start with strip and just see what it looks like and see if we can get what we need done. So let's just run this for now. Let's see what happens. So it looks like nothing has changed because again, we're not specifying any specific value just by default. It's only taking out white space. So like spaces that shouldn't be there. That's what it does by default. Now we can specify within this exactly what values we want to take out. So let's go ahead and do that. Let's say left strip unless try to take out these dots real quick. So we're just going to do a parentheses dot dot dot. Now let's run this and see what it looks like. For this one, Potter, it is now gone. So those three dots were there before. Let's just show it. So they were there. And then when I ran it like this, now they're gone. That's what the L strip does. It takes it only off the left hand side. Now we can also do a forward slash. So we do something like this and you'll get rid of the white. But as you can see, now we aren't taking out these three dots. So they're still there. Now is it possible to do something like this where we put these values inside of a list? Let's try it. So we'll say just like this, one, two, three, let's run it. And no, it doesn't. This L strip actually sits within the realm of regular expression. So if you've ever worked with regular expression, you know it gets very complicated, very complex. So you want to keep it kind of simple, especially with these values where we're just taking a few out. So what we're going to do is we're going to do dot dot dot and we're going to take it out one by one. Now in order to save this because we want to save this, we want to take out that value. We don't just want to say data frame equals because that would be very bad. What this would say is now this data frame is only equal to these values that we're seeing right here. We want to only apply it to this column. So we're going to go like this. So now when we do it and then we call the entire data frame, it's only applying this to this one column, the last name column. So let's run it. And now when we go down to potter right here, it's cleaned up. So we're going to do the same thing, but for those other values, it will do it just like this. We'll do a forward slash and it's a left strip. And then we'll do, I'll do the left strip on this underscore to just to show you that it won't work. And then we will go on from there. So it's not pulling it because we're looking at the left hand side only. We need to use R strip. So now let's use R strip. And now that looks perfect. There's no underscore. So that's how you can use strip for either the left side, the right side, or just strip by itself, which covers both sides. Now I showed you all of that because I am going to show you a different way to do it. And I apologize because I somewhat lied to you earlier. Let's run this right here. Actually, we're just going to pull it in like this. We're going to remove the duplicates again. Bear with me. We're going to drop that column. And then now we're sitting with that data frame again with those exact same mistakes. I just wanted to reset it for a second. There is a way that you can do this. And I just wanted to, you know, kind of show you how you can do it. You can do this right here. And we'll say, so we're now again, we're just looking at this column, just this column, and we're using strip. And let's get rid of our,",

    "text": "because we want to do apply it to everywhere. You can input all of those values individually. And it will clean it up. So let's say we want to get rid of numbers. We'll do one, two, three. Then we can do the dot. So that's going to be for a period or for a dot, dot, dot, potter. We can also do the underscore. And we can do the forward slash. So we put it all in one string right here. Now let's take a look at this. We'll get rid of this really quickly. Now let's take a look. And all of them were removed. I showed you how to do it before because that's at least how my mind would think about it. I'd think, Oh, I can put it in a list and run it through this L strip or this right strip. And it would work. But that's not how strip works. You have to kind of combine it all into one value. So yes, I deceived you. I apologize. But now when we call data frame and we assign it to that column. So the last name column or assigning what we just did to this last name column, everything should look perfect. And it does. So our customer ID first name last name are all cleaned up. Now we're going to come to a much more difficult one. This is probably if I'm being honest, the hardest one, I said we were going to work up, but this is probably the hardest one of the whole video working with phone numbers and look at all these different types of formats. I mean, it is, it's not going to be fun. And imagine you know, there's 20,000 of these. You can't just go and manually clean those up. You need something to kind of automate that. So that is what we're going to do. So let's go right down here. We'll copy the data frame. And I'm going to pull it right here. So now we need to clean up this phone number. What we want is it all to look exactly the same unless it's blank and we'll keep it blank. We don't want to populate that data. But we want all of them to look exactly like this one. And what we're going to do is right off the bat, we're going to take all of the non numeric values and just completely get rid of them, strip it down to just the numbers. So this 123-643 or forward slash will just be the numbers same with these bars and these slashes and everything. All of these will just be numeric. Then we'll go back and reformat it how we want to format it, which will look exactly like this one. But we just want to do it for the entire column. So let's go right up here and we're going to try a place for the first time. So let's do phone number. It just loops. That's not what I want. So we're going to do a bracket. Let's say phone number dot string dot replace just like we did before. Now we're going to use some regular expression in here. And I'll I need to do a really high overview, although I'm not going to dive super deep into the regular expression. Then we're going to do a parenthesis. And within there we're going to do a bracket. I can't remember what this is called. Is it called a carrot? I think it's called a carrot. I'm just going to call it that and may not be correct. But I think it's an upper arrow. So it's an upper arrow a dash. Oops, a dash z a dash z and then zero dash nine. Now at a super high level, what that character that first thing is doing is saying we're going to return any character except and then we specify anything a to z a to z upper or lower case. And then actually I think this should be like this a to z and then zero to nine. So any value like a b c one two three, those are not going to be matched. It's going to rematch all of them except these values. And then we're going to replace them by saying comma and we're going to place them with nothing. So this is just an empty string. So literally we're taking everything that is not an a b c one two three. So a letter or a number we're replacing all of that and then we're replacing it with nothing. So let's run this and see what it looks like. And it looks like that worked properly. Now we do have this n a because we had an n dash a for I don't know remember maybe that was Creedbrett. But it worked for basically everything else. We're going to go through the entire process and then at the end we'll remove any values. We want them to just be completely null. We don't want them to even see n a n and wonder what that is. We just want it to be blank and we'll do that the very end. So now that we know that that worked, let's assign it. We'll do df phone numbers equal to and then we'll say data frame. And this looks a lot more standardized than it did before already. But now what we want to do is try to format this. And I've done this many many times. I always use a lambda. You can definitely use a for loop. I just I don't do it that way myself. So I'm going to show you how to do it using a lambda. Let's get rid and we're going to say df phone number. We've already done that. I'm just going to get rid of it. Now we're going to say df phone number and we're going to say dot apply. We'll do an open front of the seas. And then this is where we're going to build out our lambda. So we'll say lambda x colon. Now this is where we're going to kind of format it. So what I want to do is I want to take the first three strings one two three. Then I want to add a slash and then the next three strings at a slash or a dash. And then that be the value that's returned. So it's not super difficult. We're just going to do x. Then a bracket. Let me get rid of that and x and then a bracket. And then we want the zero to three. So it goes zero one two. So zero one two. It doesn't include the three goes up to three. So zero one two. That's our third first three values. Then we'll do plus and do a quote and do a dash. So this is our first kind of sequence. And I'm just going to copy this. We'll do plus and we're instead of three. We're we are going to start at three because now it's inclusive. So we're going to go from three and we're going to go all the way up to six. So it should be three four five our next three values. Then we have a dash and we'll copy this and we'll say plus and now we go from six all the way to 10. Now let's try running this. And as you can see, we get an error. Now I already know what the error is. Float object is not subscriptable, which means we're trying to basically look at it like a string. Right now it's not a string. It's actually a number. So let me get rid of this for just a second. I'm going to show you what it's talking about. So right now we have values that are floats and values that are strings are not even a number. So we have values that are strings are not a number. So if we want to actually look through it like kind of like indexing, if we want to do that, they all have to be strings. So we need to change this entire column into strings before we can apply this formatting. Now when I was creating this, if I'm being honest, my first thought when I was doing this was to do it like this. String, DF phone number. Let's just run that. This is what the values look like. And I don't remember why or why it was doing this. I can't remember, but I looked into it quite a bit and I was like, oh, I need to apply this string converting it to a string on each value, not the entire row or not the entire column. So how we can do that is actually fairly easy because we've already done a lot of the heavy lifting. We're just going to copy this and we're going to say x to two. So string of x. And again, lambda is like a little anonymous function. So you can do this by saying four x in this column. We could do a for loop and then say for every x, it equals the string of x and then it changes it to a string. But a lambda just adds a lot quicker. So we're going to say, so let's do that really quickly. And all of our values look exactly the same. And that's how we want it. So we're just going to copy this, apply it. Good. And now we're going to take this and we're going to run this again. Just ignore all my commented out stuff. I can't, I don't have that. So now when we run this, it should work. There we go. Now if we look at these numbers, one, two, three, dash five four five, dash five four, two, one. And it does that for every single one where there's values, even whether there's NAN or NA, it's still adding those values. But we expected that. So let's apply it. Say is equal to and then we'll look at the data frame. And this looks almost exactly what we're hoping for. We just need to get rid of these. So this NAN dash dash and this NA dash, we need to get rid of those. And that is super easy to do. We're just going to say, so now that we've done it, and we'll comment that out. We'll say, DF. And let's copy this. Ignore the messiness. I do apologize for that. It's very messy. But if you're following along w",

    "text": "ith me, you get what we're doing. So DF, phone number. So only on the phone number, say dot string dot replace, no parentheses. Now we can specify this value. So we want to take this exact value and replace it with nothing. And let's just see if that does work. It does. Now we have these NAs. And so let's actually I'll paste that right down here. We're going to do this is equal to and then we're just going to take this entire string right here and put this value as our what we're looking for and then replacing. And then when we call that data frame, it should work properly. And it is perfectly cleaned. So we have every single value, all the exact same. They don't have different characters or different formatting. And we got rid of all the ones that we don't have or don't need. All the ones that were just random values. So this column is now completely cleaned up again, definitely one of the more difficult ones. One that I've done a thousand times, I've had to work with a lot of phone numbers and stuff like that. This one does get very tricky, especially if you have like a plus one, which is like an area code that can get tricky as well. But this is on a kind of a high level. This is how you can do that. And it's pretty neat how you can actually, you know, clean up and standardize those phone numbers. So let's go right down here. Let's run it. The next thing that we're going to look at is this address. Now let's just pretend that the people who are on the call center want all these separated into three different columns that can read it easier. See what the zip code is where they live. You know, whatever they want it for. Let's just say we want to do that. And this is, you know, again, for this use case, it may not make sense, but you have to do this. I do this all the time. You need to split those columns. Now luckily, all of these things are separated by a comma. So we can specify that. We're going to split on this column. And then we'll be able to create three separate columns based off of this one column, which is exactly what we want. And we can name it as well. And we can do that very easily by using this split. So we're going to say DF. And we want to specify. Oh, geez, not again. So we want to specify that we're looking at the address. Then we're going to say, dot string, dot splits. We'll do an open parentheses. Now the very first value that we need to specify is what we're splitting on. So we want to split on the comma. So we want to specify that. And then we need to specify how many values from left to right. It should look for. Now we'll just start with one. And then we'll go from there. Let's just see what this looks like. So it doesn't really look like it did anything. Let's do two. Well, let's go back to one and let let's say expand equals true. When we expand it, it's actually going to separate it, I believe. Okay, so we're expanding. We're now we're only doing this with one comma. So we're only looking at the very first comma and splitting it. But in some of these, well, just in one, there is an additional comma. So we should do it up to two. Let's do this. Okay, so now we have three columns. If we just save it like this, it's going to give us these zero one two, these basically these indexed values for these c",

And then within there, we're going to specify our list. So we have three of them that we have. So I'm going to do the first one. This is the street address. So we'll say street address. The next one is and it's shire is not a state, but these all are states. I'm just going to say state. And then the very last one, that looks like a zip code. So we'll say zip. And we'll do under start code. In fact, I also want to do street underscore address. So what this is now going to do is these three columns are going to be applied to these three names. And they'll basically be appended. It doesn't replace the address. We're not saying DF address equals DF address. We're not replacing it. We're now creating different columns. So let's run it. And then let's also call it. So they're right over here on this right hand side. I couldn't see them at first. But it did exactly what we needed it to do. So now if we wanted to at the very end, if we want to, we're not going to, we could just delete this address and keep the street address, the state, and the zip code. Another really common thing that you can do, this happens often again with like first name, last name. We'll have Alex freeberg, but it's Alex comma freeberg or Alex space freeberg. And you can separate those out into different columns. Now the next one that we want to look at is this paying customer and the paying customer and do not contact are very similar. In the fact that it's yes, no, NY, yes, no, NY. And so let's go right on down here. We're going to say DF dot. And we want to just replace these values as all yeses are all knows, but just with the same formatting, just to keep it consistent. So let's make anything that's an N into a no, anything that's a a Y into a yes, I like it spelled out. So let's change anything that's a yes into a Y, anything that's a no into an N. That's usually how I do it, just saves on data because it's less strings, although it's you can be often very minimal. But let's specify the customer. We'll suit say DF bracket paying customer. Then we'll do dot string dot replace. So now we're just going to look for those specific values. So if it's a Y, a capital Y, then we'll say yes. Now let's run it. And now we have no more Ys. We now just have yeses, although now these are yes, yeses. Okay, we don't want to do that. Let's do if we're looking because it's taking it's literally looking up here and saying, okay, there's here's a Y. Let's change the let's change that Y into a Y, yes. So now it's doing Y, yes, yes. We don't want that. So let's look for the yes and change into a Y. Now when we run this, that looks a lot better. So we'll do DF paying customers equal to and then we'll copy this. We'll do the exact same thing. No, end end. Then let's call it. And now that entire column looks really good. Except for that value right there, but I'm going to leave that because I'm just going to apply it to the entire thing. All at once to get rid of those at the end. And so I'm just going column by column. And then it's literally going to be the exact same thing. So I'm not even going to scroll down. Whoops. I'm just going to put it right up here because this is the exact same thing. I'm going to save us all some time. And when we run this, this looks exactly like what we're looking for again, some not a number o",

I forgot we can do or we can not even specify it. We'll do df dot fill and a. So we're going to fill these values. If there's nothing in them, we're going to fill it. And we're going to say. Like and when we run that, every value that doesn't have something in it is going to show up blank even over here where we only had a few all of them throughout the data frame. But if it doesn't have a value, it is now blank. So let's apply that. And we'll run this. And now all of our cleaning for actually cleaning up the individual columns is completely done. We've removed columns. We've split columns. We've formatted and cleaned up phone numbers. We've also taken values off of first name or this last name column. And then we formatted and just kind of standardized paying customer and do not contact. Now they also asked us to only give them a list of phone numbers that they can call. So if we take a look, some of these do not contacts are why, which means we cannot contact them. And then there are some that don't even have phone numbers. So we don't want to give the people the call center numbers that are people who don't have numbers. So we want to remove those. Now there's a few different ways that we can do this. But let's start with and we'll just go by this do not contact. It seems like the most obvious one. Now if it's blank, we want to give them a call. We only want to not call them if they've specifically said we cannot call them. So if it's why we're not going to call them. So what we need to do, it's not anything like this, we probably need to loop through this column and then look at each row that has a value of this and drop that entire row. And we probably will need to do that based off this index instead of doing it based off just this column. That may not make sense, but let's actually let's actually start writing it. So we'll do four X in and we need to look at our index. So we're just going to do do in df dot index and we'll do a colon enter. And then we want to look at these indexes. How do we look at these indexes? We use lock. That's going to be df dot loc. And then we need to look at the value, which is this X right here. So each time it looks at the index, it's looking at the value, but we want to look at the value of this column. Do not contact. I don't know if I copied this before. Let me copy it. We only want to look at the value in this one column. If we didn't, it would look at a different value. So we don't want that. So we're looking at just that value if it's equal to Y. So if this value is equal to Y, then we want to drop it. So we actually need to say if. So if this value X in this column is equal to Y, then we want to do df dot drop. And then we'll say X. And we think we have to say in place equals true here. Otherwise, it won't take a fact. Otherwise, have to say like df is equal to df dot. Yeah, I don't want to start messing with that. Let's just do in place equals true. And let's see if that works. I can't remember if this is going to work or not. Invalid syntax. Okay, need a colon. And now let's try to run this. Okay. Okay. Yeah. If we look at our index, we can already tell that there are ones missing. The one the one is missing, the three is missing. Let's see. And the 18 is missing. So we already got rid of those values. And you can see that there's no Ys in here anymore, which is really good. We can, if we want to, and we probably should, we should probably populate that really quickly. Let me just go here really quick. I'll copy this. We probably should populate that. And I didn't plan on doing this. So if it's blank, it's blank, given an n. And we want to attribute it to do not contact. Do not contact. Whoops. Let's see if that works. And we probably need to do dot string. Let's just see if it works. So if it's blank, do okay. I don't know why it's giving us a triple n. Maybe there's maybe need to strip this or something. Okay. Never mind. Let's not do that. But now we basically need to do the exact same thing for this phone number. Because if it's blank, we don't want them calling it. So we can copy this entire thing right down here. And but now we're looking at phone number. So now we're looking just at the values within phone number. And we only want to look at if it's blank. So if it literally has no value, we want to get rid of it. Let's run this and see if it works again. It should. Good. And now our list is getting much smaller. So you can see in our index, a lot of those rows were removed. And okay, good. Actually, this worked itself out because these all have ends. So right now we're sitting really good. Everything looks really standardized, cleaned. Everything looks great. I might drop this address. If you want to, you can drop this address. But besides that, this is all looking really good. This paying customer doesn't. The guess and nose aren't really anything. Now we could. And we probably should, before we hand this off to the client or the customer call list, we probably should reset this index because they might be confused as why there's numbers missing or you know, they might use this index to show how many people they've called her. I don't know. Something like that. So let's go right down here. We're to say df dot and then we'll do reset underscore index. And let's just see what this looks like. It does work. But as you can tell, it didn't get rid of that index completely. Actually, took the index and saved that original one. We do not need to save that. Whoops. Let's put it right in here. Now we're just going to drop equals true. And when we do that, it just completely resets. It drops the original index and gives us a new index. And that is what we want. Let's do df equals. And this is our final product. Now one thing that I you definitely could have done here. And I made this a little more complicated than it needed to be. That was just how my brain was working at the time when I'm typing this out. We could have done df dot drop and a, which is literally going to look at these null values before we couldn't do that with this one because these aren't we're not looking at n a we're looking at wise. So we couldn't do that. But because we're looking at null values, we could have also done drop and a and done subset is equal to and then done it just on this phone number. And then done like this done in place equals true. So we could have also done this. And then said df equals. I",

And I'll just save it in case you want to. I'll say another way to drop null values. There you go. And that'll just be a note for us in the future. But this is our final product. It looks a lot different than when we first started. I mean we had mistakes here. Completely different formatting in the phone number, a different address, everything that we just talked about. And this looks just a lot, lot better. And you can tell why it's really important to do this process because again, we're working on a very small data set. I purposely created this data set with these mistakes because you know, when you're looking at data that has tens of thousands, a hundred thousands, a million rows, these are all things that are going to be applied to much larger scale. And you won't be able to as easily see them. You'll have to do some exploratory data analysis to find these mistakes. And then you're going to need to clean the data or doing it at the same time when you're exploring the data. So you'll clean it up as you go. But these are a lot of the ways that I clean data, a lot of the things that you can do to make your data just a lot more standardized, a lot more visually better. And then it really helps later on with visualizations and your actual data analysis. So I hope that that was helpful. I know that this was a long video. I'm sure it was. But I hope that you got something out of this and you learned some of the techniques on how to actually clean data in pandas. If you like this video, be sure to like and subscribe. Check out all my other videos on pandas as well as Python. And I will see you in the next video.",

    "text": "Hello everybody. Today we're going to be looking at exploratory data analysis using pandas. Exploratory data analysis or EDA for short is basically just the first look at your data. During this process we'll look at identifying patterns within the data, understanding the relationships between the features, and looking at outliers that may exist within your data set. During this process you are looking for patterns and all these things, which are also looking for mistakes and missing values that you need to clean up during your cleaning process in the future. There are hundreds of ways to perform EDA on your data set, but we can't possibly look at every single thing, so I'm just going to show you what I think are something most popular and the best things that you can do when you're first looking at a data set. The first thing that we're going to do are import our libraries, so do import and does as PD. We're also going to import seaborn and matplotlib. Now, during this exploratory data analysis process, I often like to visualize as I go because sometimes you just can't fully comprehend it unless you just visualize it and it gives you a larger, broader glimpse of everything. So we're going to import and let's do seaborn. Oops, SNS. Then we'll import matplotlib.pyplot as PLT. Let's run this. This should work. Okay, perfect. Now we need to bring in our data set. So we've worked with that world population data set. That is the exact one that we're going to use now. So we'll say data frame equals PD.read, underscore CSV, do R, and we'll paste in our CSV. And this is what it should look like, although your path may be different, be sure to make sure that you have the correct file path. Now we'",

I took out a little bit of data, put in a little bit of data here and there to change things up because if it was just exactly how I pulled it, which I got this data set from Kaggle, if it was exactly how we pulled it, like we've looked at in the previous videos, it's too simple. We wouldn't actually be able to do some of the things that I would like to show you. So be sure to actually download this exact data set for this video, because it is a little bit different. But what we're going to do now is just try to get some high level information from this. Now if yours looks just a little bit different, like your values are in scientific notation, I have applied this so many times, I think it's, you know, still applied to this. You can do something and we'll write it right down here. We're going to do PD dot set underscore option. And we'll do an open parentheses and we'll say display dot float underscore format. And so we're going to change that float format by just saying lambda x colon. And then we're going to change basically how many decimal points we're looking at. So let's just do here. So do a quote, send sign point two f sort of formatting it. Whoops point two f. So we're going to format it and we'll do percent x. This is going to form out it appropriately. I mean, I can run it. And actually it will change x. This is that point one. So I believe last time I did it. So let's run this. And then let's run this again. It'll change it to point two. So that's two. I like it at point one. We don't really need it any. Well, let's keep it a point two. Why not? We're going to ke",

And this gives us just some really high level information. This is how many columns we have, here are the column names, here how many values we have. And if you notice, this is where it kind of gets. So we have 234 in each of these. So in each of these columns, we have 234 until we get to this 2022 population. Once we get there, we start losing some values. And then at the world population percentage, we have all of our values, all 234 of them. The count tells us that it's not null. So it doe",

Then if we look at the max population, one has 1.42 billion, I believe that's China. And then over here in 1970, we have 822 million. Again, I still believe that's China. But this gives you just a really nice high level of all of these values or all these different calculations that you can run on it. And we can run all these individually on even specific columns. But you know, it's just a nice high level overview. One thing that we just talked about was the null values that we're seeing in here. I'd like to see how many values we're actually missing. Because that is a problem. We don't want to have too many missing values or could really obscure or change the data sets entirely. And so we don't want that. So we'll say df.isnol. And then we'll do a parenthesis and we'll say dot sum. And when we do this, whoops dot sum, there we go. When we do this, it's going to give us all the columns and how many values we're actually missing. Now we have 234 rows of data. So we have 4147755424. So we have, we definitely have data missing.

We want to find different either outliers, missing values, things that are wrong with the data, or we can find insights into it while we're doing this as well. So this is definitely something that I would consider when I'm actually going through that data cleaning process. Really, really important information to know. Now let's go right down here to our next cell. So df.unique. And this is going to show us how many unique values and it's actually any unique. This is going to show us how many unique values are actually in each of these columns. And this one makes the most sense for continents, because I think there's only seven continents, right?

As well as these populations are such specific numbers and such large numbers, I would be shocked if any of these were similar. And then for these world population percentages, it's much lower. And again, that makes a lot of sense, because when we're looking at and we'll pull it up right here, when we're looking at these world population percentages, a lot of them are really low, 0.00, 0.01, like this one, 0.2. There are a lot of really low values for the small countries. And so those are all one unique value. Now, let's say we just have this data right here. I want to take a look at some of the largest countries. And we can easily do that. We can even we can say max and take a look at the largest country. But I want to be a little bit more strategic. I want to be able to look at some of the top range of countries. And we can do that based off this 2022 population. So we'll say df dot sort underscore values. This is how we sort and not filter, but order our data. So we'll do sort values. And then we'll do buy is equal and we'll specify that we want this 2022 population. And then we're going to say comma and we'll say actually let's just run this as is. But we'll do head. Because we just want to look at the top values. So now we're just looking at the very top values. So what we're looking at is actually these 2022 population. That's what we're filtering on or sorting on basically. And we'll get the very bottom values because it's sorting ascending. So from lowest to highest. So this Vatican city in Europe is, you know, 510. That's the value that we were looking at earlier. Now we can do comma ascending equal to false because it was by default true. We can do false. We can do false. And then it'll give us the very largest ones. So if we just take a look at the top five largest by population, we're looking at China, India, United States, Indonesia and Pakistan. And we can even specify that we want the top 10 in this head. We can bring the top 10. And we also have Nigeria, Brazil, Bangladesh, Russia and Mexico. And you can do this for literally any of these columns, whether you want to look at continent",

Let's just look at this one really quickly before we move on to the next thing. If we look at this world percentage, just China alone, I believe, just China alone is 17.88% of the world. So 17.88 and 17.77. And that's China and India. And those are very large countries with a high high population. That makes a lot of sense why that is the highest world population percentage. Again, just getting in here, looking around. That's all we're really doing. Now I want to look at something and I always like doing this, which is looking at correlations. So correlation between usually only numeric values. We can do that by saying df dot c o r r and a parenthesis. And we'll run this. And what this is is it is comparing every column to every other column and looking at how closely correlated they are. So this 2022 population, if we look across the board, it's very highly, I mean, this is a one to one. This is highly correlated to each other. And that almost",

    "text": "for all of these populations, they're very, very closely tied to each other, which makes perfect sense because for most countries, they're going to be steadily increasing. And so they're probably almost exactly correlated. But we can look at these populations. And if you look at the area, it's only somewhat correlated. And that's because in some countries, you know, they have a very high population, but a small area or vice versa, a small area in a very high population. So there isn't a one to one correlation there, but it's hard to really just glance at this and understand everything that's there. We could just visualize it and it would be a lot easier. So let's go ahead and do that. Let's go down here. We're just going to visualize this using and heat map, basically. So we're going to say sns dot heat map and an open parenthesis. And the data that we're going to be looking at is df dot core relation. And then we also want to say inout equals true, I'll kind of show you what that looks like in just a little bit. But let's do plt dot show. And this will be our first look. And I need to say show not shot. We can get a little glimpse of what it looks like, but this looks absolutely terrible. Let's change the figure size really quickly. So I want to make this much larger than it already is. We'll do plt dot rc perams rc perams right there. Do open parentheses. And then right here, we're going to do in quotes to do figure dot fig size. This actually needs to be in brackets, I believe. Just like this, not parentheses. We'll say fig size is equal to, and now we can specify the value that we want. Let's do 10 comma seven and see if this looks any better. No, no, that doesn't look good. Do 20. Okay, that looks a lot better. And you know, this is just a quick way because it gives you basically a color coded system highly correlated as this tan all the way down to basically no correlation or negative correlation even, which is black. So when we're looking at these 20, 22 populations, and these are our populations right here on this axis, we can see that all of these are extremely highly correlated very, very quickly. Whereas the rank really has nothing to do. It's negatively correlated. Doesn't really have anything to do with it. Then for the population and the world population percentage, it again is quite correlated, except for the area, density and growth rate. So I find that really interesting that, you know, the density, the growth rate in the area aren't really all that associated or correlated with the population numbers. That is, I kind of would have assumed that on some level, they w",

But even density, I guess, I guess density and growth rates, growth rate, I can see, because that's a percentile thing. That could be definitely not correlated. I thought the density would be more correlated than it is. All that to say is, this is one way that you can kind of look at your data, see how correlated it is to one another that can definitely help you know what to analyze and look at later when you're actually doing your data analysis. Let's go right down here. Something that I do almost all the time when I'm doing any type of exploratory data analysis like this, I'm going to group together columns, start looking at the data a little bit closer. So let's go ahead and group on the continent. So let's look at it right here. Let's group on this continent because sometimes when you're doing this EDA, you already know kind of what the end goal of this data set is. You know what you're looking for, what you're going to visualize at the end that you really comes in handy when doing this. But sometimes you don't. Sometimes you're just going in blind and so far we've really just been going in blind. We're just throwing things at the wind, kind of seeing some overviews, looking at correlation. That's all we've done. Now I kind of want to get more specific. I want to have like a use case, something that I'm just kind of looking for, not doing full data analysis, not diving into the depths, but something we can kind of aim for. So the use case or the question for us is, are there certain continents that have grown faster than others and in which ways? So we want to focus on these continents. We know that that's the most important column for this use case, this very fake use case. So we can group on this continent and we can look at these populations right here because we can't really see growth. You can see a growth rate, but the density per kilometer, we don't have multiple values for that, just a static one single value, same for growth rate, same for world population percentage, but we have this over a long span many, many years, you know, 50 years of data here. So this, we can see which countries have really done well or which continents have really done well. So without, you know, talking about it even more, let's do DF group by and then we'll say, continent, oops, let me just copy this. I'm not good at spelling. I'm going to say DF group by and then we'll do dot mean and we can just do it just like this. And now we have Africa, Asia, Europe, North America, Oceana and South America. Okay, so if I'm being completely honest, I knew most of these. All right, I'm no geography expert, but I knew most of these. I don't know what this Oceana is. This, I don't, I genuinely don't know what that is. So let's just search for that value and see, we'll come back up here in just a second, but I want to kind of understand what this is. So we're going to DF and we'll say continent. Let me sound that out for you guys. Um, then we'll do dot string dot contains, oops, contains, good night. And then I want to look for Oceana. Uh, and let's, let's run this. Oh, you do like this. Now let's run this. So now we're looking at our data frame. We're seeing when the values have this continent as Oceana. Um, okay. So these look like islands. I'm guessing. So we have Fiji, Guam, um, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea. Yeah, these look like all. I'm, I'm guessing based off the continent, Oceana, um, Oceania, Oceana, Oceania. Guys, this is tough for me. Okay, I'm doing my best. I, you know, this is part of the EDA process. I don't know what that means. I don't know what Oceana, Ocean, Oceania. Geez, I'm just going to call it Oceana. That's so wrong, but I'm just going to so easy for me to say, you know, I, I know I'm seeing this and it looks like islands, um, which would make sense because for their average, they have the highest average rank. Um, and I'm guessing that's because they're just mostly small continents. So let's, let's order this really quickly. We're going to do dot sort underscore values, do an open parentheses, and I want to sort on the population. We're just doing the average population. Um, we'll do by, um, equal. So on the average population and we'll do ascending equals false. So when we're looking at this average of the mean population, Asia has the highest population on average. Then we have South America, Africa, Europe, North America, and then Oceana at the very bottom, which makes perfect sense. Again, small islands, um, world population percentage. So each of the countries, each of those countries in Asia makes up about 1% on average. Really interesting, um, to know and just kind of look at this. And the density in Asia is far higher than double, almost double every single other continent. Um, really, really interesting. Actually, now that I'm looking at this, but you know, that's something that I would actually look into it. I would be like, what is this Oceana or Oceania? What does that mean? And you know, let me look into that. Let me explore that more because I want to know this data set. I'm trying to really understand this data set. Well, but what I want to do now is I want to visualize this, um, because I just feel like looking at it, I don't, it's hard to visualize. Again, the use case that we're saying is, is which continent has grown the fastest? Like, we could be percentage wise, it could be, um, you know, as just a whole on average. Let's take a look. So we're going to take this and let's copy it like this. Let's bring this right down here. So let's look at this. So if I try to visualize this and let's do that. Let's do DF2 is equal to, because I'm, I already know it's not going to look good just based off how the data's sitting. Um, we do DF2. Oops, what am I doing? I don't need to do that, but I will. Okay, DF2 and we'll do DF2.lots. I don't want to run it just like this. Um, as you can see, Asia, South America, Africa, Europe, North America, Oshina, we can kind of understand what's happening, but these are the actual values that are being visualized, not the continents, which is what I wanted. Um, in order to switch it, and it's actually pretty easy. And this is something that, um, you know, it's good to know. We can actually transpose it to where these, these continents become the columns and the columns become the index. And all you have to do is say DF2 dot transpose. And we'll do this perancy right here. And let's just look at it and then we'll save it. So now all of these columns are right here. And all of the indexes are the columns. So let's say DF3 is equal to, and I'm just doing that. So I don't, you know, right over the DF or my earlier data frames. So now we have this data frame 3. So now let's do data frame 3 dot plot. And it should look quite a bit different. Uh, whoops, I didn't run this. So run this and run this. And as you can see, this does not look right at all. And the reason is is because we're not only looking at the correct columns. We have this density in here. We're population percentage rank. We don't need any of those. The only ones that we want to keep are these ones right here. This population. Now we can do that. And we can just go right up here. This is where we created that data frame 2 that we transposed. We can get right up here and we can specify within this. We actually only want specific values. Now we can go through and handwrite all of these. And by all means go for it. But I am going to go down here. I'm going to say df dot columns. And I'm going to run this. It's going to give us this list of all of our columns. And I'm just going to you can just copy this. And you can put it right in here. I can get a list of them. I think it needs to be like this. If I'm, let me try running this. Okay. So this worked properly. You can do it just like this or a little shortcut. If you want to do it like that. If you want to do a shortcut like, um, I, I would hope you would. You would just do df dot columns just like how we looked at down here. Except since this is an index, we can search through it. So we can just say zero one two. Okay. So we can do five up to 13. Because I think it's we'll just let's see if this works. I mean, I may actually need to go like this. Let's see. There we go. So you can just use, you know, the indexing to save you some visual space gives you the exact same output. So now we have this. This is our df two. Now let's go down and transpose it. So now we just have these populations and we have our continents right here. And then now we're going to plot it. And this looks good. Although it's backward. Um, okay. It's backward. So what I actually want to do is not this. Uh, that is a quick way to do it. Although not the best way to do it. So I'm actually going to copy all of these. And although I said it would save us time, it did not at all. So I'm going to put a bracket right here. I'm going to paste this in here. And I'm literally going to change these up. I might speed this up or I might just have you sit through this because, you know, this is an interesting part of the process. And I want, you know, you to get the full experience. You know what? Now that I'm talking about it, that is what we're going to do. You guys can hang out with me. This is a good time. We have 2010, 2015, 2020, and 2022. Now let's run it. What did I do? Oh, too many brackets. There we go. So now it's ordered appropriately. We have 1970",

    "text": "all the way up to 2022. This is how we want it to transpose it appropriately. Let's run it. And now we basically have the inverted image of this. Now just out of glance. And we haven't done anything to this except for literally what we are looking at. At a glance, we can see that from 1970, China, you know, Asia and China are already in the lead by quite a bit. And it continues to drastically go up, especially in the 2000s. Like right here, it explodes. Like just straight up, then kind of starts going up and just leveling off every other continent, especially, Oshiyana, is just really low. It never has done a bunch. Let's see. Look at green. Green has gone up from, you know, point, let's say point one up to about point two. They've almost doubled in the last 50 years. And again, you can just get an overview, a high level overview of each of these, you know, continents over the span of this time. So this is kind of one way that we can, you know, look at that use case. We're not going to harp on that too long. I just want to give you an example. Like, you know, when you're looking at this, sometimes you'll have something in mind of what you're",

    "text": "looking for and you go exploring and just kind of find what's out there and find what you see. The next thing I want to look at is a box plot. Now I personally, I love box plots. You know, they're really good for finding outliers. And there's a lot of outliers. I already know this because the average and the 25th 50% dollar are very low. And then there's some really just big outliers. But for your data set, it may not be that way. And those outliers may be something that you really need to look into and box plots have been something that I've used a lot where I found those outliers that way and started to dig into the data to find those outliers. And, you know, came across some stuff that I'm like, oh, I have to clean this up. I have to go back to the source. Really, really, really powerful and useful to be able to find these. So all you have to do is df.box plot. Let's take a look at it. And this already looks good as is. Maybe I'll make it a little bit wider. Let's do fig size. Oops. Sorry. Big size is equal to, let's try 20 by 10. Okay. That didn't help at all. I apologize. I thought it would. But let's keep going. What this is showing us is that these little boxes down here, which are actually usually much larger because you have a more equal distribution of numbers or values. In the small value, this is where our average is live. This number right here is the upper range and then all these values, all of these open circles, those actually stand for outliers. So we're looking at the 2022 population. There's a lot of outliers now for our data set, knowing our data set is really important. Outliers are to be expected, especially when most countries or continents are small. So we're looking at, you know, all of these little dots are outlier countries or outlier values, which each value corresponds to a country. So if this was a different data set, I would be, you know, searching on these and trying to find these so that I can see what's wrong with them, if anything, or if they are real numbers. Like if this was revenue, everyone's revenue is way down here and then there's one company that's making like $10 trillion. That'd be an outlier up here. And it would definitely be something that you want to look into for our data set, knowing that, you know, we're looking at population. This is more than acceptable and, you know, oddly enough, but that's what box plots are really good for showing you some of those core tiles, the upper and the lower, as well as denoting these points that fall outside of those normal ranges for you to look into. So really, really useful. So now let's go down",

    "text": "here, hold our data frame again. And we've kind of just zoomed into the whole EDA process. There was one last thing that I want to show you. This is the very last thing that we're going to look at. We're ending on really a low point, if I'm being honest, because last kind of stuff was much more exciting. But there is something DF dot D types, oops, DDF dot D types. And we'll run this. Now just like info, it gave us these values, but we're actually able to search on these values now. So these object float and integer, we can search on those, which is really great, because we can do include equal. And we can do something like number. And none of these are numbers, right? Or none of them explicitly say number. But when we run it, I'm getting an error series object, not, oh, that's because I'm doing D types is for a series. We need to select underscored D types. Now let's run this. Now it's only returning the columns in this data frame, where the data types are included in this number. So you won't see any, you know, country or any of those text or the strings. If we wanted to do that, we go in here and say object and run that. And this is another really quick way where we can just filter those columns to look for specific, whether it's numeric, we could even do float in here. And so now it's not including that rank, which was an integer. So we can specify the type of data type. And it'll filter all of the columns based off of that, w",

    "text": "hich, you know, when you're doing stuff like this, you, it is good to know what kind of data types you're working with and look at just those types of data types, because there might be some type of analysis you want to perform on just that, whether it's numeric or just the string or integer columns within your data set. So again, ending on a low note, I apologize, you know, everything else that we looked at, all those other things that we looked at are all things that I typically do in some way or another when I'm looking at a data set, exploratory data analysis is really just the first look. You're looking at it, you're going to be cleaning it up, doing the data cleaning process. And then you're going to be doing your actual data analysis, actually finding those trends and patterns and then visualizing it in some way to find some kind of meaning or insight or value from that data. And again, there's a thousand different ways you can go about this. It does typically, you know, depend on the data set, but these are a lot of the ways that you'll clean a lot of different data sets. And so, you know, that's why I went into the things that we looked at in this video. So I hope that you guys liked it. I hope that you enjoyed something in this tutorial.
