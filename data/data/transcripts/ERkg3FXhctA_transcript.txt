I used AI to edit one of my clients videos and it got 2 million views and saved me two hours. Yes. Hell yeah. And in this video, I'm going to show you which AI tools can edit your whole video with no editing skills needed, especially the one that I just used and it's going to save you hours of time. The crazy thing is that you've heard of these tools, but you've never heard of these features. For example, Cap Cut has eight AI tools that people never knew about because they never hit the all tool section. And I have three other AI tools that are exactly the same way. So whether you're doing a talking head video or a faceless video, let's get into these four AI video editing tools and their hidden features that are about to change the game. Let's talk about the first tool, which is Cap Cut. All right, like I said earlier, Cap Cut has eight AI tools that is going to help you edit your video without you really having to do anything. The first two that I want to really concentrate on is auto cut and smart vlog. Now, these two do the same thing except for one can do an AI voice over, which is smart vlog, and the other one can't. Now, all you have to do is pick your favorite pictures and video, and it edits the whole thing the way that you want. You can continue to pick the different styles that you like, but literally all you have to do is pick the footage, and that's it. Now, if you're trying to create faceless content, I want you to look at scripts to video and the story maker feature. Now, this one, all you have to do is have a script or let AI generate it and it creates the whole video for you. And here's an example of that. Hey there, tech enthusiasts. Today, we're diving into the world of Apple's latest product, the iPhone headphones. Let's explore some of the top features and handy tips that make these headphones a must-have accessory. Now, the second AI tool is called Submagic. And I use this tool every single day for captions. But then I found out some features that allowed me to edit a whole video in a matter of seconds. Now one day I had to do a talking head video to promote my YouTube live and I didn't have time to edit it. So when I put it in Submic just to do captions, I saw these different features that allowed it to do B-roll. It did magic zooms. It even did the foundation of taking away the bad takes and the silences. you know those ums and a's and I don't know who says ah but definitely the ums what we're doing about it. We're going to go over some new AI tools, all of that. Comment live, come through, support the new channel because yeah, this is this is some BS. Now, a video like that would normally take me over an hour to do, but I did with a press of a button in a matter of minutes. I'm not mad at it. Now, the reason why this is one of my go-to tools is because it continues to update, right? So, as they see new captions become in trend, they add those. As they see new editing styles come in play, they add those. AI generated uh titles, they got that, right? Enhanced speech, they got that. Add your own logo, they got that. But the different AI tools to edit so you don't have to is actually unmatched. Now, all these tools that I'm talking about are going to be in the description. All the links are there. So, go check that out. Now, this third tool is called captions, and that's exactly what I thought it just did was captions, but it does so much more. It's actually like a silent killer. So, yes, it can do captions, but it can also edit your videos. It can also put you in a whole new language. It can also you can give it a script and it creates the whole video itself. And you can clone yourself. And when I say when it can edit the whole video for you and you just pick the style, I'll show you an example. I got V3 because I was like, I want to see the quality of content so I can better explain it for the audience. And this is why I say it's a sleeper because the name alone doesn't even equate to the value that it gives. Now, this last one is a fan favorite on this channel, which is Opus Clip that edits everything for you. All you have to do is give it a video or give it a link. Let me show you. So, here's the thing with Opus Clip. You can upload a video or give it a link, right? Like a YouTube link, and it'll clip up the video for you, right? To the best parts. Now, that doesn't just make a video stand out. What makes a video stand out is the captions, is the AI hook, is the enhanced speech, the B-roll, the framing it to exactly the size that you need it. Whether it is vertical for reals and Tik Tok, whether it's horizontal, whatever you may need, it does the whole thing. It reframes it. So, if you've ever seen my lives, I do a lot of screen sharing. And so, it'll put the screen up top, it'll put me on the bottom, and it'll do everything like that. Plus, it will tell you exactly if the video is going to do good based off the hook, the flow, the value, and the kind of trend that it has. and it does everything for you without you having to do a single thing. Mini bonus is that it can actually schedule out your content too to the different social media platforms. So if you cut up all of these different clips, then you can schedule it out to YouTube, Tik Tok, Instagram, whatever platforms that you have and then you have a social media calendar, which is fire. Now, I showed you four AI tools, like I said, that you heard of, but you probably didn't even know about these different features that it have. The biggest lesson that I learned is that we have tools in our phone and websites that we already use, but we don't look deeper into the AI tools that they already have. And since AI is such a trending word, everybody's trying to integrate different AI tools in them. So, we talked about Cap Cut, Submagic, Captions, and Opus Clip. Which one out of the four are you going to dive deeper into? cuz like I said, you already knew about them. But which ones are you going to dive deeper into? Drop that in the comments. Links are in there. And then of course, check out this next video.
