I don't trust humans, but I love AI. If you want to write code without crying, check out Cursor. It can explain, autocomplete, and debug like magic. If you want to build projects fast, use Replet. You can build and ship from your browser. If you want to learn machine learning like a big tech engineer, check out ML University. It has great visuals. If you want to build AI apps, use the Open AI playground.
