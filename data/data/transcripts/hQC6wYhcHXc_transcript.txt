come and watch me build a simple python automation the thing that I want to automate is the fact that I'm a software engineer and I Google a lot of things but I don't want to open up my web browser every time I want to Google something from within my term for example I wish I could do something like this where I enter in a command s which could be short for search and then how to write a for Loop and then when I enter that in it then opens up Google automatically the first thing that I need to do is figure out how to open up Google Chrome directly from a python script and I can do that with this block of code right here and then to read in this input right here I can just use the built-in python sys library and this should read in all of the arguments that I pass into my python script up here I have a list of websites that I only want to see search results from I don't want to get search results from anywhere else then in this function I actually construct my final search query added to my Google URL create an alias in my bash RC file to execute that python script now when I enter in this command it automatically executes that search query with the site filters added to it
