one of the fastest ways to create something in your physical reality is to reverse the normal process by which we create things usually we create things first by thinking about it I think I'll go to that party and then we say something about it as in Matilda I'm coming to your party tonight and then we do something about it as in showing up at the party that's generally how we produce things in our reality in fact everything in this room was once a thought there was nothing that was not once a thought in someone's mind somewhere but if you want to really play tricks with the universe and create Magic with the stuff of life itself reverse the thought word deed Paradigm turn it upside down and start with the deed that is to say act as if if you want to experience abundance be abundant and do as abundance does if you have only five dollars left to your name go to a store and get them made into singles and take five singles and walk down the street and give a single to each of five people who have even less than you do and by the way you will find those people very easily
